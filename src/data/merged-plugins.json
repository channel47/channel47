You bring the raw material—a Claude Code log, voice memo transcript, draft, or rough idea. The tool helps you find the interesting part, pressure test whether it matters, and land on what you actually want to say.\n\nThe output is a **brief**—not the post itself. The brief holds your thinking so you can write the post now or later.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Adaptive conversation**: Adjusts based on what you bring (dense logs vs rough ideas)\n- **Insight excavation**: Surfaces candidate insights for you to react to\n- **Pressure testing**: Validates whether your take actually matters\n- **Audience discovery**: Helps identify who specifically will care\n- **Brief generation**: Structured output ready for writing\n\n## Real-world use cases\n\nUse this when:\n\n- You have interesting raw material but can't find the angle\n- You know there's something worth sharing but can't articulate it\n- You've drafted something but it feels hollow\n- You want to batch-process ideas for future posts\n- You need to decide if an idea is worth writing up at all\n\nCommon scenarios:\n\n- Processing a Claude Code session into a tutorial or insight\n- Turning a voice memo ramble into a focused post\n- Pressure testing a hot take before publishing\n- Finding the shareable insight in technical work\n- Building a queue of briefs for when you have writing energy\n\n## What makes it different\n\nCurrent options for turning ideas into posts are unsatisfying. You either do all the thinking yourself—which is slow and often results in ideas dying in drafts—or you hand it to an LLM and get back something that feels hollow.\n\nPost Partner sits in the middle. It's a structured conversation that draws the post out of you. The model does real work—surfacing insights, proposing audiences, pressure testing claims—but you stay in control of the actual thinking. The words end up being yours.\n\nThis is explicitly **not a content generator**. It's a thinking tool that produces clarity, not copy.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Install: `/plugin install post-partner@channel47`\n2. Start immediately with `/post`\n\nNo configuration needed.\n\n## Example workflow\n\n**Start with raw material:**\n\n```\n/post\n```\n\nPaste your raw material. The conversation adapts:\n\n- **Dense material** (logs, transcripts): Surfaces candidate insights for you to react to\n- **Sparse material** (rough ideas): Asks questions to draw out more context\n- **Draft posts**: Skips straight to pressure testing what you're trying to say\n\n**What you get:**\n\nA brief containing:\n\n- **Raw material** — What you started with\n- **The insight** — The interesting thing, in 1-2 sentences\n- **Why it matters** — Who cares and why\n- **The audience** — Who this is for, specifically\n- **Your take** — Labeled as claim, observation, question, or provocation\n- **The entry point** — The angle for your post\n\n**Adaptive behavior:**\n\nThe model knows where it needs to end up (a complete brief) but how it gets there adapts:\n\n- If you say \"the interesting part is X\"—it skips excavation and moves to pressure testing\n- If you're circling and uncertain—it stays in exploration mode longer\n- If something you say later changes the insight—it adjusts\n- If you go quiet—it does more lifting; if you're riffing—it stays out of your way\n\nSometimes there's no post. That's fine. The tool makes it easy to exit without feeling like failure.\n\n## Available commands\n\n- `/post` - Start the brief generation process\n\nSee the [README](https://github.com/ctrlswing/channel47-marketplace/blob/main/plugins/post-partner/README.md) for more details.\n",

Get answers instantly. No GAQL syntax to memorize. No clicking through dashboards.\n\nSetup takes 10 minutes. You'll configure OAuth and API credentials. After that, you can investigate performance issues, find optimization opportunities, and answer stakeholder questions in seconds instead of hours.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Natural language queries**: \"Find wasted spend in the last 30 days\" instead of writing GAQL\n- **Negative keyword discovery**: Automated analysis of search terms for optimization opportunities\n- **Ad-hoc investigation**: Quick answers to performance questions without exporting data\n- **Full GAQL access**: Drop into raw queries when you need precise control\n- **Interactive setup wizard**: `/setup` guides you through OAuth and API configuration\n- **MCC account support**: Query across multiple accounts from one place\n\n## Real-world use cases\n\nI use this for:\n\n- Finding search terms with spend but no conversions (negative keyword candidates)\n- Investigating performance drops: \"Why did campaign X cost more this week?\"\n- Quick stakeholder answers: \"What's our CTR for brand campaigns this month?\"\n- Analyzing wasted spend on broad match keywords\n- Comparing performance across campaigns without building reports\n- Ad-hoc checks: \"Show me all paused ads with high historical CTR\"\n\nThe LLM understands context. You can ask follow-up questions naturally:\n\n- \"Show me those same metrics for last quarter\"\n- \"Which of these campaigns have the lowest conversion rates?\"\n- \"Add those search terms as negative keywords\"\n\n## What makes it different\n\nYou don't need to:\n\n- Learn GAQL syntax and field names\n- Click through Google Ads UI tabs and filters\n- Export to spreadsheets for basic analysis\n- Build custom reports for one-off questions\n\nYou just ask. The LLM translates your intent into GAQL queries. It interprets results. You can drill down conversationally.\n\n## Setup\n\n**Time investment:** ~10 minutes for initial OAuth configuration. After that, instant access forever.\n\n1. Install: `/plugin install google-ads@channel47`\n2. Run the setup wizard: `/setup`\n3. Follow prompts to configure:\n   - Google Cloud project + OAuth credentials\n   - Developer token from Google Ads API Center\n   - Refresh token generation\n\nThe wizard walks through each step with direct links and copy-paste instructions. Credentials persist across sessions after setup.\n\n**Quick troubleshooting:**\n\n- If queries fail with \"invalid_grant\": Refresh token expired (common if OAuth app in Testing mode). Re-run `/setup` and skip to Phase 5.\n- If MCP server won't connect: Verify all 5 environment variables in settings.json, then restart Claude Code.\n\nSee the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/ctrlswing/channel47-marketplace/blob/main/plugins/google-ads/GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed setup steps and troubleshooting.\n\n## Example workflows\n\n**Find negative keyword opportunities:**\n\n```\n\"Analyze search terms for account 1234567890 in the last 30 days\"\n\"Show me terms with spend but zero conversions\"\n\"Which of these would make good negative keywords?\"\n```\n\n**Investigate performance drops:**\n\n```\n\"Compare campaign metrics week over week for account 1234567890\"\n\"Why did cost increase for Brand Campaign?\"\n\"Show me the search terms driving the cost increase\"\n```\n\n**Quick stakeholder questions:**\n\n```\n\"What's our overall CTR this month?\"\n\"List top 5 campaigns by conversion rate\"\n\"How much did we spend on Shopping campaigns yesterday?\"\n```\n\n**Advanced GAQL queries:**\n\n```\n\"Run this GAQL query for account 1234567890:\nSELECT campaign.name, metrics.cost_micros, metrics.conversions\nFROM campaign\nWHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS\nORDER BY metrics.cost_micros DESC\"\n```\n\n## Available commands & skills\n\n**Setup:**\n\n- `/setup` - Interactive wizard for OAuth and API configuration\n\n**Skills:**\n\n- `/gaql-query-guide` - Reference for constructing GAQL queries and understanding available fields\n\n**Agents:**\nThe negative keyword hunter agent triggers automatically when you mention negative keywords, wasted spend, or search term analysis. It analyzes search term performance and identifies optimization opportunities.\n\n**Natural language queries:**\nJust ask questions directly:\n\n- \"List my Google Ads accounts\"\n- \"Find search terms with zero conversions for account X\"\n- \"Show me campaign performance for last week\"\n\nThe MCP server provides two tools accessible via natural language:\n\n- Account listing (shows all accounts under your MCC)\n- GAQL query execution (runs any valid Google Ads Query Language query)\n\nSee the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/ctrlswing/channel47-marketplace/blob/main/plugins/google-ads/GETTING_STARTED.md) for complete usage examples and troubleshooting.\n",
