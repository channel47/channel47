    "editorialContent": "---\nfeatured: true\ndraft: false\n---\n\n## What it does\n\nTransform your writing from AI-generated patterns to clear, honest prose. This plugin helps you write with your own voice—whether you're editing AI drafts or creating content from scratch.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Edit drafts**: Rewrite content to remove AI tells and improve clarity\n- **Generate content**: Create first drafts that match your style guide\n- **Review writing**: Get specific, actionable feedback without automatic rewrites\n- **Improve sections**: Fix openings, strengthen endings, or clean specific problems\n- **Custom style guides**: Create personalized guides through interactive questionnaire\n- **Smart chunking**: Loads only relevant style guide sections to keep token usage efficient\n\n## Real-world use cases\n\nI use this daily for:\n- Cleaning up AI-generated blog drafts (removing em-dashes, hype words, and other tells)\n- Getting feedback on technical writing without automatic rewrites\n- Fixing weak introductions that bury the lead\n- Strengthening conclusions that trail off\n- Generating initial drafts that already sound like me\n\n## What makes it different\n\nMost writing tools either give you vague feedback or rewrite everything automatically. This plugin does both—and lets you choose:\n\n- `/review-writing` gives you specific problems to fix yourself\n- `/edit-draft` rewrites everything to match your style\n- `/improve-opening` or `/strengthen-ending` focus on specific sections\n- `/remove-ai-tells` quickly strips common AI patterns\n\nAll skills work with custom style guides, so the more you use it, the better it gets at matching your voice.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Install: `/plugin install creative-writing@channel47`\n2. Try it immediately with `/edit-draft` or `/review-writing`\n3. (Optional) Create a custom style guide with `/generate-style-guide`\n\n## Example workflows\n\n**Quick cleanup:**\n```\n/remove-ai-tells\n```\nPaste your AI-generated draft. Gets back clean prose in seconds.\n\n**Thoughtful revision:**\n```\n/review-writing\n```\nGet specific feedback on what to change and why. You make the edits.\n\n**Full rewrite:**\n```\n/edit-draft\n```\nPaste your draft. The plugin rewrites it following style guide principles.\n\n**Custom style:**\n```\n/generate-style-guide\n```\nAnswer questions about your preferences. Save the guide, then use:\n```\n/edit-draft --style-guide docs/my-guide.md\n```\n\n## Available skills\n\n- `/edit-draft` - Rewrite content to match style guide\n- `/generate-content` - Create first drafts from prompts\n- `/review-writing` - Get feedback without automatic rewrites\n- `/improve-opening` - Fix first 1-3 paragraphs\n- `/strengthen-ending` - Improve conclusions\n- `/remove-ai-tells` - Strip common AI patterns (em-dashes, hype, etc.)\n- `/generate-style-guide` - Create personalized style guide via questionnaire\n\nSee the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/ctrlswing/channel47-marketplace/blob/main/plugins/creative-writing/GETTING_STARTED.md) for workflow tips and customization options.\n",

    "editorialContent": "---\nfeatured: false\ndraft: false\n---\n\n## What it does\n\nAsk questions about your Google Ads data in plain English and get answers instantly. No GAQL syntax to memorize, no clicking through dashboards—just natural conversation with your campaigns, search terms, and performance metrics.\n\nSetup takes 10 minutes (OAuth + API credentials), but once configured you can investigate performance issues, find optimization opportunities, and answer stakeholder questions in seconds instead of hours.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Natural language queries**: \"Find wasted spend in the last 30 days\" instead of writing GAQL\n- **Negative keyword discovery**: Automated analysis of search terms for optimization opportunities\n- **Ad-hoc investigation**: Quick answers to performance questions without exporting data\n- **Full GAQL access**: Drop into raw queries when you need precise control\n- **Interactive setup wizard**: `/setup` guides you through OAuth and API configuration\n- **MCC account support**: Query across multiple accounts from one place\n\n## Real-world use cases\n\nI use this for:\n- Finding search terms with spend but no conversions (negative keyword candidates)\n- Investigating performance drops: \"Why did campaign X cost more this week?\"\n- Quick stakeholder answers: \"What's our CTR for brand campaigns this month?\"\n- Analyzing wasted spend on broad match keywords\n- Comparing performance across campaigns without building reports\n- Ad-hoc checks: \"Show me all paused ads with high historical CTR\"\n\nThe LLM understands context, so you can ask follow-up questions naturally:\n- \"Now show me those same metrics for last quarter\"\n- \"Which of these campaigns have the lowest conversion rates?\"\n- \"Add those search terms as negative keywords\"\n\n## What makes it different\n\nInstead of:\n- Learning GAQL syntax and field names\n- Clicking through Google Ads UI tabs and filters\n- Exporting to spreadsheets for basic analysis\n- Building custom reports for one-off questions\n\nYou just ask. The LLM translates your intent into GAQL queries, interprets results, and lets you drill down conversationally.\n\n## Setup\n\n**Time investment:** ~10 minutes for initial OAuth configuration, then instant access forever.\n\n1. Install: `/plugin install google-ads@channel47`\n2. Run the setup wizard: `/setup`\n3. Follow prompts to configure:\n   - Google Cloud project + OAuth credentials\n   - Developer token from Google Ads API Center\n   - Refresh token generation\n\nThe wizard walks through each step with direct links and copy-paste instructions. Once configured, credentials persist across sessions.\n\n**Quick troubleshooting:**\n- If queries fail with \"invalid_grant\": Refresh token expired (common if OAuth app in Testing mode). Re-run `/setup` and skip to Phase 5.\n- If MCP server won't connect: Verify all 5 environment variables in settings.json, then restart Claude Code.\n\nSee the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/ctrlswing/channel47-marketplace/blob/main/plugins/google-ads/GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed setup steps and troubleshooting.\n\n## Example workflows\n\n**Find negative keyword opportunities:**\n```\n\"Analyze search terms for account 1234567890 in the last 30 days\"\n\"Show me terms with spend but zero conversions\"\n\"Which of these would make good negative keywords?\"\n```\n\n**Investigate performance drops:**\n```\n\"Compare campaign metrics week over week for account 1234567890\"\n\"Why did cost increase for Brand Campaign?\"\n\"Show me the search terms driving the cost increase\"\n```\n\n**Quick stakeholder questions:**\n```\n\"What's our overall CTR this month?\"\n\"List top 5 campaigns by conversion rate\"\n\"How much did we spend on Shopping campaigns yesterday?\"\n```\n\n**Advanced GAQL queries:**\n```\n\"Run this GAQL query for account 1234567890:\nSELECT campaign.name, metrics.cost_micros, metrics.conversions\nFROM campaign\nWHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS\nORDER BY metrics.cost_micros DESC\"\n```\n\n## Available commands & skills\n\n**Setup:**\n- `/setup` - Interactive wizard for OAuth and API configuration\n\n**Skills:**\n- `/gaql-query-guide` - Reference for constructing GAQL queries and understanding available fields\n\n**Agents:**\nThe negative keyword hunter agent triggers automatically when you mention negative keywords, wasted spend, or search term analysis. It analyzes search term performance and identifies optimization opportunities.\n\n**Natural language queries:**\nJust ask questions directly:\n- \"List my Google Ads accounts\"\n- \"Find search terms with zero conversions for account X\"\n- \"Show me campaign performance for last week\"\n\nThe MCP server provides two tools accessible via natural language:\n- Account listing (shows all accounts under your MCC)\n- GAQL query execution (runs any valid Google Ads Query Language query)\n\nSee the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/ctrlswing/channel47-marketplace/blob/main/plugins/google-ads/GETTING_STARTED.md) for complete usage examples and troubleshooting.\n",
