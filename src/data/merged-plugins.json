This plugin helps you write with your own voice—whether you're editing AI drafts or creating content from scratch.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Edit drafts**: Rewrite content to remove AI tells and improve clarity\n- **Generate content**: Create first drafts that match your style guide\n- **Review writing**: Get specific, actionable feedback without automatic rewrites\n- **Improve sections**: Fix openings, strengthen endings, or clean specific problems\n- **Custom style guides**: Create personalized guides through interactive questionnaire\n- **Smart chunking**: Loads only relevant style guide sections to keep token usage efficient\n\n## Real-world use cases\n\nI use this daily for:\n- Cleaning up AI-generated blog drafts (removing em-dashes, hype words, and other tells)\n- Getting feedback on technical writing without automatic rewrites\n- Fixing weak introductions that bury the lead\n- Strengthening conclusions that trail off\n- Generating initial drafts that already sound like me\n\n## What makes it different\n\nMost writing tools either give you vague feedback or rewrite everything automatically. This plugin does both—and lets you choose:\n\n- `/review-writing` gives you specific problems to fix yourself\n- `/edit-draft` rewrites everything to match your style\n- `/improve-opening` or `/strengthen-ending` focus on specific sections\n- `/remove-ai-tells` quickly strips common AI patterns\n\nAll skills work with custom style guides, so the more you use it, the better it gets at matching your voice.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Install: `/plugin install creative-writing@channel47`\n2. Try it immediately with `/edit-draft` or `/review-writing`\n3. (Optional) Create a custom style guide with `/generate-style-guide`\n\n## Example workflows\n\n**Quick cleanup:**\n```\n/remove-ai-tells\n```\nPaste your AI-generated draft. Gets back clean prose in seconds.\n\n**Thoughtful revision:**\n```\n/review-writing\n```\nGet specific feedback on what to change and why. You make the edits.\n\n**Full rewrite:**\n```\n/edit-draft\n```\nPaste your draft. The plugin rewrites it following style guide principles.\n\n**Custom style:**\n```\n/generate-style-guide\n```\nAnswer questions about your preferences. Save the guide, then use:\n```\n/edit-draft --style-guide docs/my-guide.md\n```\n\n## Available skills\n\n- `/edit-draft` - Rewrite content to match style guide\n- `/generate-content` - Create first drafts from prompts\n- `/review-writing` - Get feedback without automatic rewrites\n- `/improve-opening` - Fix first 1-3 paragraphs\n- `/strengthen-ending` - Improve conclusions\n- `/remove-ai-tells` - Strip common AI patterns (em-dashes, hype, etc.)\n- `/generate-style-guide` - Create personalized style guide via questionnaire\n\nSee the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/ctrlswing/channel47-marketplace/blob/main/plugins/creative-writing/GETTING_STARTED.md) for workflow tips and customization options.\n",
