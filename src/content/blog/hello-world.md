I've spent an embarrassing amount of time wiring together skills and subagents in Claude Code. Custom workflows for the tedious tasks I do constantly. Read-only MCP servers that connect to APIs I use every day. Prompts that actually solve my specific problems instead of generic ones I have to adapt.

Those individual pieces work fine for me. But if you've ever tried to get a non-technical teammate to clone a repo, edit a config file, and restart their terminal, you understand why that approach doesn't scale. Channel 47 is where I'm bundling those pieces into things other people can actually install and use.

I asked Claude what to build first. The answer was simple: start with the most painful problem you have right now. So I'm building skills for common workflows that take too many steps, MCP servers for integrations I kept rebuilding manually, and prompts that skip the configuration dance.

This is the collection for people who use Claude Code every day and want the tedious parts to just work.
