This is the first post on Channel 47. More content coming soon.

## What's Channel 47?

A collection of tools for people who use Claude Code every day.

> **Me:** What should I build first?
> **Claude:** Start with the most painful problem you have right now.

That's the approach here. Real problems, real solutions.

## What's coming

- Skills for common workflows
- MCP servers for integrations
- Prompts that actually work

Stay tuned.
