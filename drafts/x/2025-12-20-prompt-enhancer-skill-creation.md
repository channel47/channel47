# X Content for: Building a Bulletproof Prompt Enhancer: A TDD Approach to AI Optimization

## Hook Tweet
Asked Claude to optimize 4 prompts. Result: 0/4 used XML tags, 1 explicitly "skipped advanced techniques" under time pressure. Built a systematic solution with TDD. [LINK]

## Thread Opener
I was frustrated with inconsistent prompt optimization from Claude.

Same request, wildly different approaches. Sometimes XML tags, sometimes not. Under pressure? "Let me skip the advanced techniques."

So I applied TDD to build a bulletproof solution... [LINK]

## Question Format
When you ask Claude to "quickly optimize this prompt," does it ever skip important techniques to save time?

I documented this pattern across multiple tests and built a systematic solution using TDD principles. [LINK]
