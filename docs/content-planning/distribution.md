## Platform Playbooks

### X (Twitter)

**Role:** Daily touchpoints, build in public, community building

**What works:**
- Threads (5-12 tweets) for deep content
- Standalone observations and insights
- Behind-the-scenes screenshots
- Real numbers and results
- Replies and engagement on related topics

**What doesn't:**
- Pure self-promotion
- Vague motivational content
- Links in first tweet (kills reach)
- Threads without a hook

**Optimal posting:**
- Morning: 8-10am (captures morning scroll)
- Midday: 12-2pm (lunch break traffic)
- Avoid weekends for professional content

**Thread structure:**
```
Tweet 1: Hook (curiosity, bold claim, or question)
Tweet 2: Context/setup
Tweets 3-N: Main content (one idea per tweet)
Final: Summary + CTA (follow, save, reply)
```

**CTA options:**
- "Follow for more [topic]"
- "Save this thread"
- "Which of these resonates most?"
- "Reply with your experience"

### Substack

**Role:** Anchor content, email list building, long-form authority

**What works:**
- In-depth tutorials and guides
- Personal stories with lessons
- Original frameworks
- Data and case studies
- Consistent publishing schedule

**What doesn't:**
- Clickbait without substance
- Irregular posting
- No clear takeaway
- Walls of text (use formatting)

**Structure for articles:**
```
Headline: [Curiosity or Benefit]

Opening hook (1-2 sentences)

The problem/context (2-3 paragraphs)

The solution/insight (bulk of article)
- Use headers to break up sections
- Include examples and specifics
- Add visuals where helpful

Key takeaways (bullet points)

CTA (comment, share, or check out Channel 47)
```

**Subject line formulas:**
- "How I [achieved result] without [common assumption]"
- "The [number] [things] that [benefit]"
- "[Counterintuitive take] about [topic]"
- "Why [common belief] is wrong"

### LinkedIn

**Role:** Professional reach, B2B angle, repurposed content

**What works:**
- Personal stories with professional lessons
- Contrarian takes on industry norms
- Before/after transformations
- "Here's what I learned" posts
- Carousel documents (for tutorials)

**What doesn't:**
- Obvious self-promotion
- Excessive hashtags
- Generic advice
- Monday motivation clichés

**Post structure:**
```
Hook line (stop the scroll)

[blank line]

Short paragraphs
(2-3 lines max)

[blank line]

More content...

[blank line]

Question or CTA to drive engagement
```

**Reframing for LinkedIn:**
- X: "I automated my Google Ads work with Claude"
- LinkedIn: "As a marketing consultant, I was spending 10+ hours/week on manual ad management. Here's how I changed that..."

### Vibe Marketers Community

**Role:** Niche engagement, relationship building, feedback

**When to post:**
- When you have genuinely helpful insights
- When your content directly answers someone's question
- When sharing results/case studies relevant to discussion

**When NOT to post:**
- Every time you publish something
- When your content is only tangentially related
- Just to drive traffic

**Approach:**
1. Read the room—what are people discussing?
2. Only share if you're adding real value
3. Engage in discussion, don't just drop links
4. Be helpful first, promotional never

## Atomization Playbook

### Substack → X Thread

Take your Substack article and extract:
1. The main insight (becomes hook tweet)
2. 3-5 supporting points (become thread tweets)
3. The conclusion/lesson (becomes final tweet + CTA)

**Example:**
- Article: "How I replaced 10 hours of weekly ad management"
- Thread hook: "I used to spend 10+ hours every week on Google Ads busywork. Now I spend 1. Here's exactly how:"

### Substack → X Standalone Tweets

Extract 3-5 single insights that work independently:
- One surprising stat or result
- One counterintuitive take
- One specific tactic
- One lesson learned
- One observation

### Substack → LinkedIn Post

Reframe with professional context:
- Add your role/credential
- Emphasize the business impact
- Use more formal language
- End with a question for engagement

### X Thread → Substack

If a thread performs well:
- Expand each tweet into a paragraph
- Add more context and examples
- Include visuals or screenshots
- Create a permanent, searchable resource

## Engagement Tactics

### First Hour Rule
The first hour after posting is critical for algorithm reach. Plan to:
- Respond to every comment
- Add additional context in replies
- Thank people for sharing/saving

### Comment Strategy
Leave thoughtful comments on:
- Related creators' posts
- Industry news/discussions
- Questions you can answer

**Good comment:**
"I've seen this exact pattern. We switched to [approach] and saw [specific result]. The key was [insight]."

**Bad comment:**
"Great post! 🙌"

### Building Relationships
1. Identify 10-20 accounts in your space
2. Genuinely engage with their content
3. Add value in replies
4. Over time, they'll reciprocate

## Content Recycling

### Evergreen content can be reshared:
- 3-6 months later on X
- Quarterly on LinkedIn
- Updated annually on Substack

### When recycling:
- Update any outdated info
- Tweak the hook/angle slightly
- Note that it's an update if relevant
