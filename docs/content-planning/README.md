# Content Planning System

This folder contains the content strategy for driving traffic to Channel 47.

## Two Content Modes

### 1. Build in Public
**Purpose:** Build trust, spark curiosity, grow followers

Share real progress, experiments, and behind-the-scenes moments:
- Revenue milestones and metrics
- Technical challenges and solutions
- User feedback and iterations
- Honest failures and pivots

**Platforms:** X (primary), LinkedIn

### 2. Educational
**Purpose:** Establish authority, drive SEO traffic, attract leads

Teach what you know about Claude Code plugins, AI automation, and marketing:
- How-to guides and tutorials
- Framework breakdowns
- Tool comparisons
- Case studies with results

**Platforms:** Substack (anchor), LinkedIn, X (atomized)

## Platform Strategy

| Platform | Role | Cadence |
|----------|------|---------|
| Substack | Anchor content (long-form) | Weekly |
| X | Daily touchpoints + build updates | Daily |
| LinkedIn | Professional repurposed content | 2-3x/week |
| Vibe Marketers | Community engagement | When relevant |

## The Atomization Workflow

One piece of anchor content becomes many:

```
Substack Article (anchor)
    ├── X thread (key points)
    ├── X single tweets (3-5 standalone insights)
    ├── LinkedIn post (professional angle)
    └── Community comment (if relevant discussion)
```

**Rules:**
1. Write Substack first (most complete thinking)
2. Extract 1 thread + 3-5 standalone tweets for X
3. Reframe for LinkedIn (add professional context)
4. Only share in community when genuinely helpful
