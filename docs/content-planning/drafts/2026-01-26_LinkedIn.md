I ran an e-commerce business selling mushroom spores. We grew it mostly through SEO. That worked until late 2023, when it stopped working.
Instead of fixing the business, I spent most of 2024 tinkering. AI coding tools were starting to emerge, and I figured maybe I could use them to dig myself out. I didn't. But I kept the lights on long enough—partly through setting up Google Ads for the first time.
By early 2025, I had built up this whole toolkit of AI skills. Agents, MCP servers, Claude Code. I felt like I could build almost anything. But I couldn't deploy any of it in a meaningful way. My business partners didn't want to move off WordPress. The business was at a stalemate. I had all this capability and nowhere to point it.
Then my old boss offered me a role as the Google specialist at an agency I used to work with. I took it. Partly for the paycheck, mostly because I wanted a constrained goal. Something to actually build toward.
That was November. It's now late January.
I've been building a Claude Code plugin for the job. I manage 30+ accounts across two MCCs. Now I can open my terminal, prompt Claude, and audit all of them in one sentence. Pull search term data, keyword data, RSA performance. Create new campaigns. Add negatives. Fix ads that aren't following best practices. All without opening the Ads UI.
I'm giving it away free and open source. It's called Channel47.
Works with your existing MCC and developer token. Takes maybe ten minutes to set up. After that, you just prompt.
Repo's public: github.com/channel47/channel47
If you want updates as I build, there's a simple signup at channel47.dev. No courses. No pitch decks. Just what I'm shipping.
