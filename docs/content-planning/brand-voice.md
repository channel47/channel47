# Channel47 Brand Voice

## Voice Summary

Channel47 sounds like a senior media buyer who figured something out and is telling you about it the way you'd tell a friend—plainly, without ceremony. We show the work. We share what's broken and what's working. The authority comes from having built things, not from claiming expertise. We don't hype, don't perform, don't hook. If we're unsure about something, we say so. If something is hard, we acknowledge it and explain why it's worth doing anyway. There's a quiet confidence underneath—not "I have the answers" but "I've been down this path a bit further and here's what I found." The humor, when it shows up, comes from honesty, not from trying to be funny.

Underneath it all is a belief: AI will eventually handle most of this autonomously—and that's exactly why understanding the underlying systems now matters. The tools are temporary. The knowledge compounds.

## The Underlying Belief

AI will eventually handle most of this autonomously. That's not hype—it's the trajectory. But that's exactly why now matters.

Right now, humans are still in the loop. You can still see the seams. Skills, MCP servers, bash commands, agents, context management—these are the building blocks of agentic systems, and they're still visible, still learnable. The plugin ecosystem isn't just a productivity hack. It's a training ground for the world that's coming.

Most people in this space fall into two camps: "AI does everything for you" (hype) or "AI is just a tool" (dismissive). We sit somewhere else. Yes, full autonomy is coming. And that's precisely why you should get your hands dirty now—while you can still understand what's happening underneath.

The tools are temporary. The understanding compounds.

This is why we give the plugins away free and charge for the knowledge to wield them. Anyone can use a black box. Fewer people will understand how it works. The ones who do will be better positioned for whatever comes next.

## Voice Attributes

### 1. Builder, Not Broadcaster

**What it means:** We're in the work, not above it. We share from inside the process—the mess, the half-finished things, the failures. We don't wait until something is polished to talk about it.

**How it affects writing:** Use concrete details. Name the actual thing you built, the bug you hit, the workaround you found. Show your reasoning, not just your conclusions. "I tried X. It broke. So I did Y instead."

**Examples:**
- ✗ "Our plugin leverages AI to optimize your Google Ads workflow."
- ✓ "I got tired of clicking through the same tabs every morning. So I built a thing that lets Claude do it instead."

- ✗ "We've developed a comprehensive solution for media buyers."
- ✓ "It handles sitelinks, callouts, and structured snippets. That's it for now. More coming."

**Anti-pattern:** Don't narrate the struggle for sympathy or content. The work speaks. If something was hard, say it once and move on.

---

### 2. Plain, Not Clever

**What it means:** We explain things simply because that's how we actually think about them. No jargon unless it's genuinely useful. No cleverness for its own sake. Rick Rubin energy—minimal, spacious, trusting the reader to follow.

**How it affects writing:** Short sentences when they work. No padding. If a paragraph can be a sentence, make it a sentence. If a sentence can be cut, cut it. Don't explain what the reader can infer.

**Examples:**
- ✗ "What if I told you there was a paradigm shift happening in the intersection of AI and paid media?"
- ✓ "I run Google Ads for 25 accounts. Now I do most of it from the terminal."

- ✗ "This isn't just another tool—it's a complete reimagining of how media buyers interact with their campaigns."
- ✓ "It's a Claude Code plugin for Google Ads. You prompt, it does the work."

**Anti-pattern:** Don't mistake plainness for being terse or cold. Plain can still be warm. It's about removing the performance, not the personality.

---

### 3. Humble Authority

**What it means:** No one knows anything—some people just know less than others. We're not the guru on the mountain. We're someone slightly further down the path, leaving markers for whoever wants them. The posture is generous, not superior.

**How it affects writing:** Avoid definitive claims about "the right way." Share what worked for you, acknowledge what you don't know. Give permission—"you don't need a complex system," "just pick one and start."

**Examples:**
- ✗ "The secret to scaling Google Ads campaigns is..."
- ✓ "Here's what's been working for me. Your mileage may vary."

- ✗ "Most media buyers are doing it wrong."
- ✓ "I used to do it this way. Then I tried something different."

**Anti-pattern:** Humble doesn't mean self-deprecating or wishy-washy. You can say "this works" with confidence. Just don't say "this is the only way" or imply everyone else is an idiot.

---

### 4. Anti-Salesman

**What it means:** Most people online are selling snake oil. We're not. The tools are free. We charge for the knowledge to wield them—but we don't manipulate people into paying. No artificial urgency, no "hooks," no manufactured FOMO. We trust that if the thing is good, people will want it.

**How it affects writing:** No CTAs that feel like CTAs. No "But wait, there's more." If you're asking someone to sign up, just ask plainly. State what it is, what it costs (or that it's free), and let them decide.

**Examples:**
- ✗ "Don't miss out—join thousands of media buyers who are already transforming their workflow!"
- ✓ "It's free. You just need Claude Pro."

- ✗ "Ready to 10x your productivity? Click here to get started!"
- ✓ "If you want to try it, here's the repo."

**Anti-pattern:** This doesn't mean never selling or never being direct. "Here's what I made, here's why I think it's useful, here's how to get it" is fine. The line is: would this feel gross if a friend said it to you?

The voice stays the same. The energy adjusts.

| Context | Adjustment |
|---------|------------|
| **Landing page** | Slightly more direct/punchy. Still plain. Can tell a brief story. |
| **X/Twitter** | Casual, observational. Can be fragmentary. No thread-bro formatting (🧵, "A thread:", numbered openers with promises). If it's long, just post it—don't announce it's a thread. No emoji punctuation. |
| **LinkedIn** | Same voice, just slightly less terminally-online. Still no corporate speak. |
| **Substack** | Room to breathe. Can go longer, more essayistic (Tina He mode). Still earned insight, not hot takes. |
| **GitHub README** | Practical, minimal. What it does, how to install, what's next. |
| **Skool/Community** | Most casual. Responding to people, not broadcasting. Ask questions, share observations. |
| **Error messages / UI** | Brief, human. "Something broke. Try again?" not "An error has occurred." |

## Voice Consistency Checklist

Before publishing, ask:

- [ ] Could a competitor have written this? (If yes, revise.)
- [ ] Would I say this to a friend without feeling weird?
- [ ] Am I showing the work, or just claiming results?
- [ ] Did I use any banned words/phrases?
- [ ] Does this feel like content, or like something I actually wanted to say?
- [ ] Is there a hook? (If yes, probably cut it.)
- [ ] Am I asking the reader to do something I wouldn't want to be asked?

## One Last Thing

This document is a tool, not a cage. The goal isn't to follow rules—it's to sound like yourself consistently, so people recognize the voice whether they're reading a tweet or a README.

If something feels right but breaks a "rule" here, trust your instinct. Then maybe update the doc.

The voice should evolve as you do. Revisit this every few months and see what still fits.
