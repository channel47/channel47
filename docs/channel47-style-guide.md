# Channel 47 Style Guide

## Sentence Structure

Write short, direct sentences. Aim for 15-20 words maximum per sentence.

Put one idea in each sentence. If you're joining two thoughts, use a period instead of a comma or dash.

Avoid subordinate clauses. Turn them into separate sentences.

Use active voice. The subject should do the action.

## Paragraph Structure

Keep paragraphs short. Target 2-4 sentences per paragraph.

Start each paragraph with the point. Don't bury the insight in the middle or end.

Following sentences should support, qualify, or extend the opening point.

No paragraph should exceed 6 sentences. If it's longer, split it.

## Hierarchy Rules

Use H2 headings to separate major sections within a page. Each H2 should mark a distinct topic shift.

Use H3 headings sparingly. Only create subsections when concepts genuinely divide into distinct parts.

Use bold to emphasize key terms or concepts. Don't bold entire phrases or sentences.

Don't use italics except for publication names, product names, or book titles.

Use bulleted lists for 3+ related items. Use numbered lists only for sequential steps.

## Voice Principles

Write like you're explaining something to a colleague over coffee. Conversational but not sloppy.

Choose precise words over casual approximations. "Fast" is better than "pretty quick."

Don't hedge. Remove words like "probably," "maybe," "I think," "it seems."

Don't use unnecessary intensifiers. Cut "very," "really," "actually," "extremely."

Contractions are fine. Use "I'm," "you're," "it's," "don't."

Don't qualify your expertise. If you built it and tested it, say so directly.

## Content Type Flexibility

Marketing pages (homepage, about, plugin pages) should be maximally concise. Every sentence should justify its existence.

Blog posts can use longer narrative sections when walking through complex workflows or telling stories. But they still follow the sentence and paragraph structure rules.

Plugin pages should focus on what the plugin does and how to use it. Skip the backstory.

All content follows the same sentence structure, paragraph rules, and voice principles. The flexibility is in narrative depth, not writing style.

## Common Patterns to Avoid

Don't start sentences with "So," "Well," or "Now."

Don't use rhetorical questions as transitions. Just make the point.

Don't use em-dashes to join thoughts. Use periods.

Don't use adverbs to modify verbs when a better verb exists. "Walked quickly" should be "hurried."

Don't use "thing" or "stuff" as nouns. Name what you mean.

Don't write "In order to." Just write "To."

Don't write "Whether or not." Just write "Whether."

Don't write "The fact that." Cut it entirely and restructure.
