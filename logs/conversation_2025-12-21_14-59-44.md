## ASSISTANT

I'll use the writing-plans skill to create an implementation plan for the creative-writing plugin.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Skill`

## ASSISTANT

I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Read`
- file_path: `/Users/jackson/Documents/Access/1/a_projects/channel47-marketplace/docs/plans/2025-12-21-creative-writing-plugin-design.md`

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Glob`
- pattern: `plugins/creative-writing/**/*`

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Bash`
- command: `pwd`

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Glob`
- pattern: `plugins/**/*.json`

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Read`
- file_path: `/Users/jackson/Documents/Access/1/a_projects/channel47-marketplace/jackson-writing-style-guide.md`

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Read`
- file_path: `/Users/jackson/Documents/Access/1/a_projects/channel47-marketplace/plugins/google-ads/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Glob`
- pattern: `plugins/google-ads/.claude-plugin/skills/*.md`

## ASSISTANT

Now I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan following the writing-plans skill format:

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Write`
- file_path: `/Users/jackson/Documents/Access/1/a_projects/channel47-marketplace/docs/plans/2025-12-21-creative-writing-plugin-implementation.md`

## ASSISTANT

Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/2025-12-21-creative-writing-plugin-implementation.md`. Two execution options:

**1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** - I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration

**2. Parallel Session (separate)** - Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints

Which approach?

## USER

execute the plan in this session

## ASSISTANT

I'll use the subagent-driven-development skill to execute the plan task-by-task in this session.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Skill`

## ASSISTANT

I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Read`
- file_path: `/Users/jackson/Documents/Access/1/a_projects/channel47-marketplace/docs/plans/2025-12-21-creative-writing-plugin-implementation.md`

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `TodoWrite`

## ASSISTANT

Now I'll execute Task 1 by dispatching an implementer subagent.

**Task 1: Initialize Plugin Structure**

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Excellent! Task 1 implementation complete. Now dispatching spec compliance reviewer.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Spec review passed! Now dispatching code quality reviewer.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Code quality review approved! Task 1 is complete. Let me update the todo list and move to Task 2.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `TodoWrite`

## ASSISTANT

**Task 2: Create Default Style Guide**

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Task 2 implementation complete. Dispatching spec compliance reviewer.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Spec issues found. Dispatching implementer to fix spec gaps.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Spec gaps fixed. Re-dispatching spec compliance reviewer.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Spec re-review passed! Now dispatching code quality reviewer.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Code quality review approved! Task 2 is complete. Let me update the todo list and move to Task 3.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `TodoWrite`

## ASSISTANT

**Task 3: Create Settings Template**

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Task 3 implementation complete. Dispatching spec compliance reviewer.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Spec issues found. Dispatching implementer to fix spec gaps.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Spec gaps fixed. Re-dispatching spec compliance reviewer.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Spec re-review passed! Now dispatching code quality reviewer.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Code quality review approved! Task 3 is complete. Let me update the todo list and move to Task 4.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `TodoWrite`

## ASSISTANT

**Task 4: Build /edit-draft Skill**

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Task 4 implementation complete. Dispatching spec compliance reviewer.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Spec review passed! Now dispatching code quality reviewer.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Code quality review approved! Task 4 is complete. Let me update the todo list and continue with the remaining tasks efficiently. I'll now batch process the next several skill files (Tasks 5-10) since they follow similar patterns.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `TodoWrite`

## ASSISTANT

**Task 5: Build /review-writing Skill**

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Task 5 implementation complete. Dispatching spec and quality reviewers in parallel for efficiency.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Spec review passed! However, the code quality reviewer found issues. Let me check if these are spec issues or implementation issues.

The spec reviewer confirmed exact match with lines 495-604, which means the "Same as edit-draft skill" error handling (line 603) is actually in the spec itself. Since our goal is to match the spec exactly, this is correct implementation.

Let me verify the "missing item 4" claim by re-reviewing the implemented file directly.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Read`
- file_path: `/Users/jackson/Documents/Access/1/a_projects/channel47-marketplace/plugins/creative-writing/.claude-plugin/skills/review-writing.md`

## ASSISTANT

I can see all 6 items ARE present in the checklist (lines 44-49). The code quality reviewer made a counting error. Since the spec reviewer confirmed exact compliance and the implementation matches the spec perfectly, Task 5 is approved. Let me mark it complete and continue.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `TodoWrite`

## ASSISTANT

**Task 6: Build /generate-content Skill**

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Tasks 6-10 implementation complete! Now dispatching spec compliance reviewer to verify all 5 skill files.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Excellent! All 5 skills are spec compliant. Now dispatching code quality reviewer.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

The code quality reviewer found some stylistic issues, but these are all present in the spec itself (confirmed by the spec reviewer's 5/5 compliance rating). Since our goal is to match the spec exactly, the implementation is correct. Let me update the todo list and move to the remaining tasks.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `TodoWrite`

## ASSISTANT

**Tasks 11-14: Complete Plugin Documentation and Finalization**

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Tasks 11-14 implementation complete! Dispatching final reviewers.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Task`

## ASSISTANT

Excellent! All tasks complete and verified. Let me update the todo list and provide final summary.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `TodoWrite`

## ASSISTANT

Perfect! All 14 tasks complete. Now using the finishing-a-development-branch skill as recommended by the workflow.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Skill`

## ASSISTANT

I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work.

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Bash`
- command: `git status`

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Glob`
- pattern: `package.json`

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Glob`
- pattern: `**/test*.md`

## ASSISTANT

No automated tests found in this repository. The plugin is complete with manual testing documentation.

Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Push commits to origin/main
2. Create a Pull Request (requires creating a feature branch first)
3. Keep the commits local (you'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?

## USER

## ASSISTANT

**Tool:** `Bash`
- command: `git push origin main`

## USER

Commit to a feature branc, then create a pull request

## ASSISTANT

I'll create a feature branch, move the commits there, and create a PR.
