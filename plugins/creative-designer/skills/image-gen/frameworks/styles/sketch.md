# Sketch: Raw Ideation

## The Essence

Sketching captures thought in motion. It's the most direct translation from mind to image—quick, unpolished, authentic. Sketches embrace imperfection as proof of process. Whether rough concept art or refined pencil work, the style suggests ideation, creativity, and the human hand at work. The best sketches feel like you caught an artist thinking.

## Core Principles

### 1. Line Weight Carries Meaning

Varying line thickness creates depth and emphasis.

**In Practice:**
- Thicker lines for foreground/important elements
- Lighter lines for background/secondary details
- Confident strokes for main forms
- Tentative lines for exploration

**Prompt Keywords:**
- varied line weight, thick and thin lines
- bold outlines, delicate lines
- confident strokes, gestural lines
- fine linework, heavy lines

### 2. Embrace Incompleteness

Sketches don't fill every space. Negative space is part of the aesthetic.

**In Practice:**
- Leave areas unfinished
- Faded edges suggest continuation
- Focus detail on key areas
- White space as breathing room

**Prompt Keywords:**
- unfinished, incomplete
- fading edges, trailing off
- rough, work in progress
- selective detail, focused rendering
- white background, floating on paper

### 3. Medium Characteristics

Different sketch tools have distinct personalities.

**In Practice:**
- Pencil: soft, erasable, tonal
- Ink: bold, permanent, graphic
- Charcoal: dramatic, textured, atmospheric
- Digital: clean or textured by choice

**Prompt Keywords:**
- pencil sketch, graphite drawing
- ink drawing, pen and ink
- charcoal sketch, conte crayon
- ballpoint pen, felt tip marker
- digital sketch, Procreate sketch

### 4. Hatching and Shading

How sketches create tone and volume.

**In Practice:**
- Cross-hatching for controlled shading
- Contour hatching follows form
- Scribble shading for energy
- Minimal shading for line focus

**Prompt Keywords:**
- cross-hatching, hatching
- contour lines, form lines
- scribble shading, loose shading
- line art only, no shading
- tonal pencil work, value study

### 5. Paper and Texture

The surface affects the final look.

**In Practice:**
- Smooth paper for clean lines
- Textured paper for rough, organic feel
- Toned paper for mid-value base
- Sketchbook aesthetic for authenticity

**Prompt Keywords:**
- on white paper, on cream paper
- textured paper, rough paper
- toned paper, gray paper
- sketchbook page, notebook paper
- paper texture visible
