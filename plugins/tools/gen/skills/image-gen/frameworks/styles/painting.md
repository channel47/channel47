# Painting: Artistic Expression

## The Essence

Painting style embraces visible artistic process—brushstrokes, texture, and the hand of the artist. Unlike photography's pursuit of accuracy or illustration's clarity, painting prioritizes emotion and interpretation. The medium becomes part of the message. From Renaissance oils to impressionist landscapes to contemporary abstracts, painting styles carry centuries of artistic tradition.

## Core Principles

### 1. Brushwork is Voice

The way paint is applied carries as much meaning as the subject.

**In Practice:**
- Impasto: thick, textured strokes for energy
- Smooth blending: classical, refined technique
- Visible brushwork: impressionistic, expressive
- Dry brush: texture and atmosphere

**Prompt Keywords:**
- visible brushstrokes, impasto technique
- smooth blending, sfumato
- loose brushwork, expressive strokes
- palette knife, thick paint
- watercolor washes, ink wash

### 2. Color Theory in Practice

Painters think about color relationships, not just individual hues.

**In Practice:**
- Warm/cool contrast creates depth
- Complementary colors vibrate
- Limited palettes create harmony
- Color temperature shifts in shadows

**Prompt Keywords:**
- warm palette, cool tones
- complementary colors, analogous colors
- limited palette, earth tones
- vibrant, saturated, muted
- chiaroscuro, tenebrism

### 3. Medium Matters

Each painting medium has distinct characteristics.

**In Practice:**
- Oil: rich, blendable, traditional
- Watercolor: transparent, flowing, delicate
- Acrylic: versatile, bold, modern
- Gouache: opaque, flat, illustrative

**Prompt Keywords:**
- oil painting, oil on canvas
- watercolor, aquarelle
- acrylic painting, gouache
- fresco, tempera
- digital painting, Procreate style

### 4. Artistic Movements

Reference historical movements for specific aesthetics.

**In Practice:**
- Impressionism: light, color, moment
- Expressionism: emotion, distortion, intensity
- Realism: accurate, detailed, observational
- Abstract: non-representational, pure form

**Prompt Keywords:**
- impressionist style, Monet-like
- expressionist, Van Gogh style
- classical realism, academic painting
- abstract expressionist, contemporary art
- baroque, renaissance, romantic period

### 5. Composition and Light

Painters manipulate reality for dramatic effect.

**In Practice:**
- Dramatic lighting (chiaroscuro) for impact
- Atmospheric perspective for depth
- Rule of thirds or golden ratio
- Strategic focal points

**Prompt Keywords:**
- dramatic lighting, chiaroscuro
- atmospheric perspective, sfumato
- golden ratio composition
- focal point, leading the eye
- vignette, spotlight effect

## Recommended Settings

|---------|-------|--------|
| Model Tier | Pro | Better texture and detail rendering |
| Best Aspect Ratios | 4:3, 3:4, 1:1 | Traditional painting formats |
