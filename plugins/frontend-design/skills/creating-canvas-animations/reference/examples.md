# Worked Examples

Real-world animation patterns inspired by [Interface Craft](https://interfacecraft.dev).

These demonstrate how to apply primitives + composition principles, not templates to copy.

For detailed implementations, see the specific example files:

| Pattern | Reference |
|---------|-----------|
| Diagonal Lines | @example-lines.md — Parallel stripes with drift animation |
| Grid/Mosaic | @example-grid.md — Rectangular tiles with color variation |
| Matrix Rain | @example-matrix.md — Character columns with fade trails |
| Wireframe UI | @example-wireframe.md — Interface skeleton with reveal animation |
| Combining | @example-combining.md — Layering multiple techniques |

## General Principles

- **Adapt, don't copy** — Use these as starting points, not templates
- **Single effect first** — Master one technique before combining
- **Performance aware** — Each layer has a cost; test on target devices
- **Color harmony** — Pull colors from CSS custom properties for consistency
