## Framework + Headline Category Matrix

## Framework Mixing Guidelines

**Don't mix frameworks** within a single ad group. Keep consistent:
- All headlines follow same framework
- Descriptions align with headline framework

**Do test frameworks** across ad groups:
- Ad Group A: PAS framework for problem keywords
- Ad Group B: FAB framework for solution keywords
- Ad Group C: 4Ps framework for brand keywords
