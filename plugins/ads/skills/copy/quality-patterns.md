# Quality Patterns

Patterns for writing high-converting ad copy: specifics over generics, benefits over features, and diverse headline angles.

---

## Generic vs Specific Claims

Generic claims fail because everyone uses them. Specific claims convert because they're believable.

### Transformation Table

| Generic (Avoid) | Specific (Use) | Why It Works |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| "Best quality" | "FDA-Registered" | Authority proof |
| "Fast results" | "Results in 15 Minutes" | Concrete timeframe |
| "Affordable" | "Just $29" or "From $9.99/mo" | Real price point |
| "Many customers" | "150,000+ Customers" | Quantified social proof |
| "Top rated" | "4.8 Stars (1,247 Reviews)" | Verifiable claim |
| "Professional grade" | "Used by 500+ Clinics" | Industry validation |
| "Great service" | "Same-Day Response" | Measurable promise |
| "Save money" | "Save $47 Per Order" | Specific savings |
| "Long lasting" | "Lasts 6 Months" | Defined duration |
| "Easy to use" | "3-Step Process" | Concrete simplicity |
| "Natural ingredients" | "97% Plant-Based" | Quantified claim |
| "Works fast" | "Works in 4 Hours" | Specific speed |
| "Trusted brand" | "Since 2008" or "Family-Owned" | Origin story |
| "High quality" | "Medical-Grade Silicone" | Material specification |
| "Money back guarantee" | "60-Day Full Refund" | Specific terms |

### The Specificity Test

Ask: "Could a competitor say the exact same thing?"

- If YES → Too generic, find specifics from LP
- If NO → Specific enough, use it

## Benefit vs Feature Guide

Features describe the product. Benefits describe what the customer gets.

### Feature → Benefit Translation

| Feature (What It Is) | Benefit (What You Get) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| 10-hour battery | Work all day without charging |
| HEPA filter | Breathe cleaner air |
| 500 sq ft coverage | Clean air in every room |
| Enzyme-based formula | Eliminates odors at the source |
| 30-day supply | One month of protection |
| Same-day shipping | Get it tomorrow |
| Live chat support | Get help in minutes |
| Wireless design | Use it anywhere |
| Compact size | Fits in your bag |
| Auto-shutoff | Never worry about safety |

### Benefit Categories

**Functional benefits** (practical outcomes):
- Saves time
- Saves money
- Reduces effort
- Solves problem

**Emotional benefits** (feelings):
- Peace of mind
- Confidence
- Pride
- Relief

**Social benefits** (status/identity):
- Impress others
- Fit in
- Stand out
- Appear successful

### Target Ratio

```
Ideal copy mix:
├── Benefits: 70%
└── Features: 30%

Headlines: 80% benefit-focused
Descriptions: 70% benefit-focused
```

### Benefit-First Rewrite Examples

**Feature-first (weak):**
"Our cleaner uses enzyme technology to break down stains."

**Benefit-first (strong):**
"Stains disappear completely. Our enzyme formula works at the molecular level."

### Category 5: Trust/Proof

**Purpose:** Build credibility and reduce risk.

- "[Years] in Business"

**Examples:**
- "150,000+ Happy Customers"
- "4.8 Stars, 1,000+ Reviews"
- "FDA-Registered Facility"
- "Featured in Good Housekeeping"

## Copy Antipatterns

Patterns that hurt conversion rates.

### Antipattern 1: Vague Superlatives

**Bad:** "The Best Cleaner Ever Made"
**Why:** Unbelievable, unverifiable, generic
**Fix:** "Removes 99.9% of Bacteria" (specific, provable)

### Antipattern 2: Feature Dumping

**Bad:** "Contains enzymes, surfactants, and natural citrus oils in a pH-balanced formula"
**Why:** No benefit, technical overwhelm
**Fix:** "Breaks down stains naturally. Safe for all surfaces."

### Antipattern 3: Missing Urgency

**Bad:** "Shop our collection of cleaning products"
**Why:** No reason to act now
**Fix:** "Free shipping ends tonight. Shop now."

### Antipattern 4: No Social Proof

**Bad:** "Try our highly effective stain remover"
**Why:** Your word vs their skepticism
**Fix:** "Join 150,000+ customers who eliminated stains for good"

### Antipattern 5: Generic CTA

**Bad:** "Click here to learn more"
**Why:** Vague, weak, no value
**Fix:** "Get your free sample" or "See it work in 60 seconds"

### Antipattern 6: Price Without Value

**Bad:** "$49.99"
**Why:** Price without context = objection
**Fix:** "$49.99 (saves $200 in carpet cleaning)" or "Just $1.67/day"

### Antipattern 7: Competitor Bashing

**Bad:** "Better than [Competitor Name]"
**Why:** Trademark issues, looks desperate
**Fix:** "The #1 Alternative" or "Switch & Save 40%"

### Antipattern 8: Unsubstantiated Claims

**Bad:** "Revolutionary technology"
**Why:** Meaningless buzzword
**Fix:** "Patented enzyme formula" or "New 3-step process"

## Message Match Scoring

How to measure LP language reuse:

### Scoring Method

1. List all unique phrases extracted from LP
2. Count phrases used in final copy
3. Calculate percentage

```
Message Match % = (LP phrases used / Total phrases in copy) × 100
```

### Benchmarks

| Score | Rating | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 80%+ | Excellent | Strong message match |
| 60-79% | Good | Acceptable, could improve |
| 40-59% | Fair | Review for generic replacements |
| <40% | Poor | Rewrite using more LP language |

### What Counts as LP Language

**Counts (exact or close match):**
- Exact phrases from headlines
- Product names as written
- Specific numbers/stats
- Testimonial quotes
- Brand slogans
- Feature descriptions

**Doesn't count:**
- Common words (the, and, with)
- Generic benefit words (better, best, great)
- Your own paraphrasing
- Industry standard terms
