## Psychological Triggers

Principles that drive action, applied to 30-character headlines.

### 1. Loss Aversion

People feel losses 2x more than gains.

| Trigger | Gain Frame (Weaker) | Loss Frame (Stronger) |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Money | Save $50 Today | Stop Wasting $50/Month |
| Time | Get 2 Hours Back | Losing 2 Hours Daily? |
| Results | Get Better Sleep | Missing Quality Sleep? |
| Opportunity | Get 20% Off | Don't Miss 20% Off |

**Patterns:**
- "Stop [wasting/losing/missing]..."
- "Don't let [problem] cost you..."
- "You're [losing/missing] [benefit]"
- "[Problem] is costing you [amount]"

---

### 2. Social Proof

What others do signals what we should do.

| Type | Headline Pattern | Example |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Numbers | `[#]+ [people] chose [product]` | 150,000+ Chose Our Plan |
| Reviews | `[Rating] Stars from [#] Reviews` | 4.8 Stars, 5,000 Reviews |
| Authority | `[Expert] Recommended` | Dentist Recommended |
| Peer | `Join Fellow [Identity]` | Join Fellow Entrepreneurs |
| Trending | `[Year]'s Most Popular [Category]` | 2024's Top Mattress |

**Most persuasive order:**
1. Specific numbers (127,432 > "thousands")
2. Relevant peer group (your tribe)
3. Authority endorsement
4. Trending/popularity

---

### 3. Scarcity

Limited availability increases perceived value.

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Quantity | `Only [#] Left` | Only 8 Left in Stock |
| Time | `[Offer] Until [Deadline]` | Free Shipping Until Friday |
| Access | `Limited to [#] [People]` | Limited to 500 Members |
| Edition | `[Season/Year] Limited Edition` | 2024 Limited Edition |
| Batch | `Small Batch [Product]` | Small Batch Release |

**Ethical scarcity rules:**
- Must be true
- Vague scarcity ("limited time") is less effective than specific ("ends Friday")
- Explain why it's limited if possible

---

### 4. Authority

Expertise and credentials build trust.

| Authority Type | Pattern | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Credential | `[Certification]-[Approved/Cleared]` | FDA-Cleared Device |
| Expert | `[Expert Type] Developed` | Dermatologist Developed |
| Institution | `As Used by [Institution]` | As Used by Harvard |
| Award | `[Award] Winner` | Editor's Choice Winner |
| Years | `[#] Years of Experience` | 25 Years of Excellence |

---

### 5. Reciprocity

Give value first to create obligation.

| Pattern | Example | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `Free [Valuable Thing]` | Free Shipping on All Orders | Most common |
| `Get [Gift] With Purchase` | Free Case With Phone | Bonus gift |
| `[#]-Day Free Trial` | 30-Day Free Trial | Try before buy |
| `No [Fee/Commitment]` | No Setup Fees Ever | Remove friction |
| `[Free Resource] Inside` | Free Recipe Book Inside | Content offer |

---

### 6. Commitment/Consistency

Small yeses lead to big yeses.

| Pattern | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `Take the First Step` | Low commitment | Start Your Free Trial |
| `See If [Product] Is Right` | Self-selection | See If You Qualify |
| `Just [Simple Action]` | Minimize effort | Just Add Water |
| `[Quick Action] Now` | Immediate small ask | Check Your Rate Now |

---

### 7. Curiosity Gap

Open a loop that demands closure.

| Pattern | Example | Why It Works |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `The [Secret/Truth] About [Topic]` | The Truth About Protein | Implies hidden knowledge |
| `What [Experts] Know About [X]` | What Doctors Know | Insider information |
| `The [Adjective] Mistake [People] Make` | The Costly DIY Mistake | Fear of error |
| `Why [Surprising Fact]` | Why Diets Fail You | Counterintuitive |
| `This [Thing] Changes Everything` | This Tool Changes Cooking | Bold promise |

**Caution:** Must deliver on the curiosity. Bait-and-switch kills trust.

---

## Dynamic Keyword Insertion (Search RSA)

Insert search terms directly into headlines for relevance.

### Syntax

```
{KeyWord:Default Text}
```

- `KeyWord` = inserts the triggering keyword with title case
- `Default Text` = shows if keyword is too long for character limit

### Capitalization Options

| Syntax | Keyword "running shoes" Becomes |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| `{keyword:default}` | running shoes |
| `{Keyword:default}` | Running shoes |
| `{KeyWord:default}` | Running Shoes |
| `{KEYWORD:default}` | RUNNING SHOES |

### Patterns for DKI

| Pattern | Example | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `Shop {KeyWord:Products}` | Shop Running Shoes | Generic fallback |

| `Find Your {KeyWord:Perfect Fit}` | Find Your Running Shoes | Search intent |
| `Top-Rated {KeyWord:Products}` | Top-Rated Running Shoes | Social proof |

### When to Use DKI

**Good uses:**
- High-volume, similar keywords in one ad group
- Generic product categories
- Location insertion: `{KeyWord:Your Area}`

**Avoid when:**
- Keywords are too varied (grammatically awkward)
- Brand campaigns (looks weird with your own brand)
- Keywords have typos (they'll insert typos)
- Emotional/problem keywords ("fix my broken marriage" as headline = bad)

### Character Limit Math

The default must fit within 30 characters including surrounding text.

| Headline Structure | Available for Default |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| `Buy {KeyWord:X}` | 26 chars for X |
| `Best {KeyWord:X} Online` | 19 chars for X |
| `{KeyWord:X} - Free Shipping` | 14 chars for X |

### DKI Checklist

- [ ] Default text makes sense alone
- [ ] All keywords in ad group are grammatically compatible
- [ ] No keywords with typos
- [ ] Tested at max keyword length
- [ ] Not using for brand terms
