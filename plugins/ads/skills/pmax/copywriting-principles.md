## Core Principles

### 1. Price Anchoring

Compare to expensive alternatives to make your price feel like a deal.

**Pattern:** "[Benefit] without the [expensive alternative] price"

**Examples:**
- "Salon-quality results without salon prices"
- "Professional-grade tools at DIY prices"
- "Designer look for less"

**Why it works:** Creates implicit comparison that positions your product as smart value.

### 2. Social Proof with Specificity

Specific numbers outperform vague claims.

**Weak:** "Thousands of happy customers"
**Strong:** "127,000+ units sold"

**Weak:** "Highly rated"
**Strong:** "4.8 stars from 3,200+ reviews"

**Pattern:** "[Specific number] + [proof type]"

**Examples:**
- "Join 50,000+ subscribers"
- "Trusted by 12,000+ professionals"
- "500,000+ treatments delivered"

---

### 3. Simple Benefits Over Complex Features

State outcomes plainly. Avoid hedging language.

**Weak:** "Up to 6 weeks of smooth skin"
**Strong:** "Hair-free for 6 weeks"

**Weak:** "May help reduce appearance of wrinkles"
**Strong:** "Visibly younger skin in 14 days"

**Pattern:** "[Outcome] + [timeframe]"

**Hedging words to avoid:**
- "Up to"
- "May help"
- "Can potentially"
- "Helps support"

---

### 4. Mechanism + Result

Combine the feature (how) with the benefit (what you get).

**Pattern:** "[Mechanism] for [result]"

**Examples:**
- "IPL technology for permanent hair reduction"
- "Medical-grade formula for clinical results"
- "Patented cooling system for pain-free treatment"
- "Triple-action formula for all-day protection"

**Why it works:** Mechanism adds credibility, result adds motivation.

---

### 5. Urgency Without Desperation

Create genuine urgency, not fake scarcity.

**Avoid:**
- "Only 3 left!" (when untrue)
- "Buy now or miss out forever!"
- All caps urgency

**Use:**
- Seasonal relevance: "Summer-ready in 4 weeks"
- Natural deadlines: "Free shipping ends Sunday"
- Inventory truth: "Limited batch release"
