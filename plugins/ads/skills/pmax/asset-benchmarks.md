## Image Asset Benchmarks

| Asset Type | Minimum | Recommended | Maximum | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Landscape** (1.91:1) | 1 | 5-8 | 20 | Required. Most Display placements. |
| **Square** (1:1) | 1 | 5-8 | 20 | Required. Discovery, YouTube feeds. |
| **Portrait** (4:5) | 0 | 3-5 | 20 | Optional but strongly recommended for mobile. |
| **Logo Square** (1:1) | 1 | 1-2 | 5 | Required. |
| **Logo Landscape** (4:1) | 0 | 1 | 5 | Optional. Better brand display on some placements. |

### Why These Numbers?

**Minimum (1-1-0):** Meets Google's requirements. Campaign will run but with limited optimization opportunities.

**Recommended (5-8 per type):** Gives Google's algorithm enough variety to:
- Test different visuals across placements
- Find winning combinations
- Avoid creative fatigue
- Match to different audience segments

**Maximum (20 per type):** Google's hard limit. Rarely needed unless:
- Very high spend campaigns
- Multiple product lines in one asset group
- Extensive A/B testing planned

## Text Asset Benchmarks

| Asset Type | Minimum | Recommended | Maximum | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Headlines** (30 char) | 3 | 11-15 | 15 | More = more combinations tested |
| **Long Headlines** (90 char) | 1 | 3-5 | 5 | Used on larger placements |
| **Descriptions** (90 char) | 2 | 4-5 | 5 | Support headlines with details |
| **Business Name** (25 char) | 1 | 1 | 1 | Your brand name |

### Headline Strategy

**Aim for variety across these dimensions:**

1. **Benefit-focused** (3-4): "Smooth Skin in 4 Weeks"
2. **Feature-focused** (2-3): "IPL Technology At Home"
3. **Price/Value** (2-3): "Professional Results, DIY Price"
4. **Social Proof** (2-3): "100,000+ Happy Customers"

## Extension Benchmarks

| Extension Type | Minimum | Recommended | Maximum | Notes |
|----------------|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Sitelinks** | 0 | 6-8 | 25 | Link to key pages (products, categories, about) |
| **Callouts** | 0 | 10-15 | 25 | Short benefit phrases |
| **Structured Snippets** | 0 | 2-3 headers | 25 | Category-specific lists |

### Callout Strategy

Use callouts for attributes that don't fit headlines:

- Shipping: "Free Shipping Over $50"
- Guarantees: "30-Day Money Back"
- Support: "24/7 Customer Service"
- Trust: "FDA Cleared"
- Convenience: "Easy Returns"

## Video Asset Benchmarks

| Format | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Landscape** (16:9) | 0 | 1-2 | YouTube in-stream, Discovery |
| **Square** (1:1) | 0 | 1 | Feed placements |
| **Portrait** (9:16) | 0 | 1-2 | Shorts, vertical placements |

**Duration recommendations:**
- 15 seconds: Minimum for Shorts/bumpers
- 30-60 seconds: Optimal for storytelling
- Up to 3 minutes: Maximum useful length

**If no video:** Google auto-generates from images. Quality is lower but campaigns still run.

## Budget-Based Recommendations

### Under $1,500/month

**Priority:** Meet minimums, focus on quality over quantity.

| Asset | Quantity |
|-------|----------|
| Landscape images | 1-3 |
| Square images | 1-3 |
| Portrait images | 1-2 |
| Headlines | 5-8 |
| Descriptions | 2-3 |

**Rationale:** Lower budgets = fewer impressions = less data for optimization. Better to have fewer, high-quality assets.

---

### $1,500 - $5,000/month

**Priority:** Standard launch package for meaningful testing.

| Asset | Quantity |
|-------|----------|
| Landscape images | 3-5 |
| Square images | 3-5 |
| Portrait images | 2-3 |
| Headlines | 10-12 |
| Descriptions | 4-5 |
| Sitelinks | 4-6 |
| Callouts | 8-10 |

**Rationale:** Enough budget to generate data. More assets = more combinations to test and optimize.

---

### $5,000 - $15,000/month

**Priority:** Full optimization package.

| Asset | Quantity |
|-------|----------|
| Landscape images | 5-10 |
| Square images | 5-10 |
| Portrait images | 3-5 |
| Headlines | 15 (max) |
| Descriptions | 5 (max) |
| Long headlines | 5 (max) |
| Sitelinks | 8-10 |
| Callouts | 15+ |
| Video (if available) | 1-2 per format |

**Rationale:** High spend generates significant data. Maximize options for algorithm optimization.

---

### Over $15,000/month

**Priority:** Maximum assets + multiple asset groups.

Consider splitting into multiple asset groups by:
- Product line
- Audience segment
- Funnel stage (prospecting vs remarketing)

Each asset group should have near-maximum assets for its focus.

## Asset Performance Thresholds

After 2 weeks of data, review asset performance:

| Rating | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Best** | Top performer | Keep, create variations |
| **Good** | Above average | Keep |
| **Low** | Below average | Monitor, may replace |
| **Learning** | Insufficient data | Wait for more impressions |

**When to replace assets:**
- "Low" rating for 3+ weeks
- Creative fatigue (declining CTR over time)
- Seasonal relevance expired
- Better performing concepts identified
