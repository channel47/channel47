# Illustration: Designed Clarity

## The Essence

Illustration distills reality into intentional visual communication. Unlike photography which captures, illustration constructs. Every element is a choice—nothing is accidental. The style ranges from minimalist icons to detailed editorial art, but always maintains visual logic and purposeful design.

## Core Principles

### 1. Line Quality Defines Character

Lines carry personality. They're the skeleton of illustration.

**In Practice:**
- Clean, uniform lines for modern/corporate
- Varied line weight for hand-crafted feel
- No outlines for flat design
- Thick outlines for bold, graphic impact

**Prompt Keywords:**
- clean lines, crisp edges, vector art
- hand-drawn lines, sketchy outlines
- flat design, no outlines
- bold outlines, thick strokes
- line art, linework

### 2. Intentional Color Palettes

Color isn't observed—it's chosen. Limited palettes create cohesion.

**In Practice:**
- 2-4 color palettes for impact
- Complementary colors for energy
- Analogous colors for harmony
- Accent colors draw attention

**Prompt Keywords:**
- limited color palette, two-tone
- pastel colors, vibrant colors
- monochromatic, duotone
- flat colors, gradient fills
- bold primary colors, muted earth tones

### 3. Stylization Levels

How far from reality do you go?

**In Practice:**
- Minimal: Simple shapes, icons, symbols
- Moderate: Recognizable but simplified
- Detailed: Rich but still stylized
- Realistic: Illustration that approaches photo

**Prompt Keywords:**
- minimalist, simple shapes, iconic
- stylized, simplified forms
- detailed illustration, intricate
- semi-realistic, editorial illustration

### 4. Negative Space as Design Element

What you don't draw matters as much as what you do.

**In Practice:**
- Use white space for breathing room
- Let backgrounds participate in the design
- Silhouettes leverage negative space
- Asymmetrical layouts create interest

**Prompt Keywords:**
- negative space, white space
- clean background, isolated on white
- silhouette, cutout style
- minimal background, floating elements

### 5. Visual Hierarchy

Guide the eye deliberately through composition.

**In Practice:**
- Size creates importance
- Color draws attention
- Position establishes reading order
- Contrast separates elements

**Prompt Keywords:**
- centered focal point, clear hierarchy
- layered composition, foreground/background
- spot color, color accent
- balanced composition, asymmetrical layout

## Recommended Settings

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Model Tier | Flash or Pro | Flash for simple, Pro for detailed |
| Best Aspect Ratios | 1:1, 16:9, 4:3 | Depends on use case |
| Grounding | Usually false | Style over accuracy |
