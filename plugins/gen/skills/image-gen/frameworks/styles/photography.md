# Photography: Capturing Reality

## The Essence

Photography style creates images that look like they were captured by a camera. The goal is photorealism—images that feel authentic, with proper lighting physics, depth of field, and natural imperfections. Great photographic prompts think like a photographer: consider your lens, your light, and your moment.

## Core Principles

### 1. Lighting is Everything

The quality and direction of light defines the mood entirely.

**In Practice:**
- Specify light source: natural, studio, ambient
- Describe quality: soft, harsh, diffused, dramatic
- Indicate direction: backlit, side-lit, overhead, golden hour

**Prompt Keywords:**
- golden hour, blue hour, soft natural light
- studio lighting, three-point lighting, Rembrandt lighting
- backlit, rim light, soft box, diffused light
- dramatic shadows, high key, low key

### 2. Depth and Focus

Cameras create depth through focus. Use this to direct attention.

**In Practice:**
- Shallow depth of field (bokeh) isolates subjects
- Deep focus keeps everything sharp (landscapes)
- Selective focus guides the viewer's eye

**Prompt Keywords:**
- shallow depth of field, bokeh, blurred background
- 85mm portrait lens, f/1.4, f/2.8
- tack sharp, deep focus, everything in focus
- macro, close-up, telephoto compression

### 3. Lens Character

Different focal lengths create different feels.

**In Practice:**
- Wide (24mm): Environmental, expansive, slight distortion
- Standard (50mm): Natural perspective, documentary
- Portrait (85mm): Flattering compression, subject isolation
- Telephoto (200mm+): Compression, distant subjects brought close

**Prompt Keywords:**
- 35mm lens, 50mm lens, 85mm portrait lens
- wide angle, telephoto, macro lens
- fisheye, tilt-shift, anamorphic

### 4. Composition Fundamentals

Photographic composition follows established rules.

**In Practice:**
- Rule of thirds for balanced framing
- Leading lines draw the eye
- Negative space creates breathing room
- Symmetry for impact

**Prompt Keywords:**
- rule of thirds, centered composition
- leading lines, negative space
- symmetrical, asymmetrical balance
- framed by, foreground interest

### 5. Color and Grading

Post-processing defines the final mood.

**In Practice:**
- Warm tones for comfort, nostalgia
- Cool tones for modern, clinical
- High contrast for drama
- Muted colors for film look

**Prompt Keywords:**
- warm color grading, cool tones
- high contrast, muted colors
- film grain, Kodak Portra, Fuji colors
- desaturated, vibrant, cinematic color grade

## Recommended Settings

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Model Tier | Pro | Better photorealism and detail |
| Best Aspect Ratios | 3:2, 4:3, 16:9 | Standard camera formats |
| Grounding | True for real locations | Improves accuracy of known places |

## Example Prompts

**Basic:**
"portrait of a woman"

**Enhanced:**
"Portrait of a woman in her 30s, soft natural window light from the left, shallow depth of field with creamy bokeh, 85mm lens at f/1.8, warm skin tones, subtle smile, looking slightly off-camera, clean background, professional headshot quality"

## Before/After Examples

**User Says:** "a coffee shop"
**Enhanced Prompt:** "Cozy corner of an artisan coffee shop, morning light streaming through large windows, shallow depth of field focusing on a steaming latte in the foreground, blurred patrons in background, warm color grading, shot on 35mm lens, lifestyle photography style"

**User Says:** "mountain landscape"
**Enhanced Prompt:** "Dramatic mountain landscape at golden hour, jagged peaks catching warm light against deep blue shadows, foreground wildflowers in soft focus, deep depth of field, wide angle 24mm perspective, high dynamic range, nature photography"

## When to Use This Style

- Product photography for e-commerce
- Professional headshots and portraits
- Real estate and architectural shots
- Food photography
- Lifestyle and editorial content
- Any time authenticity matters

## Combining With Other Styles

- **+ Illustration:** Creates "illustrated photo" hybrids
