# Newsletter

Write newsletters people actually want to read. 9 formats from curated to story-driven.

---

## Why Newsletters Work

Newsletters build something social media can't: a direct, owned relationship with your audience.

No algorithm decides who sees your content. No platform takes a cut. When someone gives you their email, they're inviting you into their inbox—the most personal digital space they have.

But inboxes are crowded. The average person gets 120+ emails a day. Your newsletter competes with everything: work emails, promotions, personal messages, other newsletters.

The newsletters that survive this competition share one trait: **they deliver value that justifies the attention.**

Value doesn't mean length. It means relevance, usefulness, or entertainment that the reader can't easily get elsewhere.

## The 9 Newsletter Formats

### 1. The Curated Digest

**What it is:** Handpicked links to the best content from around the web, organized by theme.

**Best for:** Audiences drowning in information who need a trusted filter.

**Structure:**
- 5-15 links per issue
- Brief description + your take on each
- Organized into logical sections
- Your commentary is the differentiator

**Examples:** Dense Discovery, TLDR, The Hustle

**Why it works:** You do the work of finding good content so they don't have to. Your taste becomes the value.

**Keys to success:**
- Actually curate (don't include filler)
- Add your perspective on each link
- Consistent quality standard
- Find things they wouldn't find themselves

### 2. The Personal Essay

**What it is:** One longer piece exploring an idea, story, or lesson from your experience.

**Best for:** Thought leaders, creators building personal brands, audiences who want depth.

**Structure:**
- Single topic per issue
- 500-1,500 words
- Personal stories + broader insights
- Conversational, first-person tone

**Examples:** Paul Graham's essays, James Clear's 3-2-1

**Why it works:** Readers feel like they're getting a personal letter from someone they admire. Authenticity builds trust.

**Keys to success:**

## The Newsletter Anatomy

### Subject Line

Your subject line determines whether the email gets opened.

**What works:**
- Specific over vague
- Curiosity without clickbait
- Numbers and specifics
- Personal tone
- 40-60 characters

**Formulas:**
- "How [Person/Company] [Achieved Result]"
- "[Number] Things I Learned About [Topic]"
- "The [Adjective] Guide to [Topic]"
- "Why [Counterintuitive Claim]"
- "[Personal story hook]"

**What to avoid:**
- ALL CAPS
- Excessive punctuation!!!
- Misleading promises
- Generic descriptions ("March Newsletter")

### Opening Section

The first few sentences determine if they keep reading.

**Strong openers:**
- Start mid-story
- Ask a provocative question
- State a surprising fact
- Make a bold claim
- Address the reader directly

**Weak openers:**
- "Welcome to this week's newsletter..."
- "I hope you're doing well..."
- "In this issue, we'll cover..."

### Body Content

**Formatting for email:**
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Lots of white space
- Bold key points
- Use bullets sparingly
- One main idea per section

**Length guidelines:**
- Curated: 500-1,000 words
- Essay: 500-1,500 words
- Educational: 1,000-3,000 words
- Keep most newsletters under 5-minute read

### Calls to Action

Every newsletter should have a purpose beyond "inform."

**CTA types:**
- Reply to engage
- Click to read more
- Share with others
- Buy/subscribe
- Visit site

**CTA placement:**
- Single main CTA (too many dilutes impact)
- Place after you've delivered value
- Make it specific and low-friction

### Sign-Off

End with personality. The sign-off is a relationship touchpoint.

**Options:**
- Personal sign-off with your name
- Preview of next issue
- Question to encourage replies
- Quote or thought to linger on

## Building Consistency

### Finding Your Cadence

**Weekly:** Most common. Enough to stay top-of-mind, sustainable to produce.

**Daily:** High engagement but demanding. Works for news/curation.

**Bi-weekly or Monthly:** Easier to maintain quality. Risk of being forgotten.

**Rule:** Better to be consistently good than inconsistently great. Pick a cadence you can sustain.

### Templates and Systems

Create a repeatable structure:
1. Same sections in same order
2. Same visual formatting
3. Same tone and voice
4. Predictable send time

Readers come to expect and look forward to the structure.

### Batching Content

Don't start from scratch each week:
- Keep a running list of ideas
- Save interesting links as you find them
- Write drafts ahead of schedule
- Build a backlog for busy weeks

## Measuring What Matters

### Key Metrics

**Open Rate:** Are subject lines working? (Benchmark: 30-40%+ for engaged lists)

**Click Rate:** Is content driving action? (Benchmark: 2-5%)

**Reply Rate:** Are readers engaging? (Often best indicator of quality)

**Unsubscribe Rate:** Are you losing people? (Under 0.5% is good)

**Growth Rate:** Is the list growing? (Track new subscribers vs. unsubscribes)

### Quality Over Quantity

A small, engaged list beats a large, dead one.

1,000 subscribers who open every email and reply regularly > 50,000 subscribers with 10% open rate.
