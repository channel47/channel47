# Email Sequences

The emails between "subscribed" and "purchased." Welcome, nurture, conversion, and launch sequences that move people forward.

---

## Why Sequences Beat Broadcasts

A single email is a moment. A sequence is a journey.

Sequences work because:
- **Timing:** Right message at the right stage
- **Automation:** Works while you sleep
- **Personalization:** Triggered by behavior
- **Nurturing:** Builds relationship over time
- **Conversion:** Multiple touchpoints = higher conversion

People rarely buy on first contact. Sequences give you multiple chances to connect, educate, and convert.

## The 6 Core Sequence Types

### 1. Welcome Sequence

**Purpose:** Make a great first impression, deliver promised value, set expectations.

**Trigger:** New subscriber/signup

**Length:** 3-7 emails over 7-14 days

**Goals:**
- Deliver the lead magnet (if applicable)
- Introduce yourself/brand
- Set expectations for future emails
- Segment based on interests
- Begin building trust

**Typical Structure:**

| Email | Timing | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Immediate | Deliver lead magnet + warm welcome |
| 2 | Day 2 | Your story / why you do this |
| 3 | Day 4 | Your best content / quick win |
| 4 | Day 6 | Social proof / what others achieved |
| 5 | Day 8 | Soft intro to your offer |

**Email 1: The Delivery Email**
- Subject: Direct reference to what they signed up for
- Body: Deliver immediately, brief intro, set expectations
- CTA: Access the resource

**Email 2: The Origin Story**
- Subject: Curiosity or personal hook
- Body: Why you do what you do, relatable struggle
- CTA: Reply or engage

**Email 3: The Quick Win**
- Subject: Specific benefit promise
- Body: One actionable tip they can use today
- CTA: Implement the tip

**Email 4: The Proof**
- Subject: Results-focused
- Body: Case study, testimonial, or your own results
- CTA: Learn more

**Email 5: The Bridge**
- Subject: Transition to offer
- Body: Connect their problem to your solution
- CTA: Check out offer (soft)

### 2. Nurture Sequence

**Purpose:** Build trust, demonstrate expertise, keep brand top-of-mind.

**Trigger:** After welcome sequence, ongoing

**Length:** Ongoing (weekly/bi-weekly)

**Goals:**
- Deliver consistent value
- Establish authority
- Build relationship
- Prime for future offers

**Content Mix:**
- Educational content (how-to, tips)
- Stories and case studies
- Industry insights
- Behind-the-scenes
- Curated resources

**The 80/20 Rule:** 80% value, 20% promotion. Most emails should help without asking for anything.

**Nurture Email Formulas:**

**The Lesson Learned**
- Story of a mistake or challenge
- What you learned
- How they can apply it

**The Framework**
- Introduce a simple framework
- Explain each component
- Give an example

**The Quick Win**
- One specific, actionable tip
- Why it works
- How to implement today

**The Case Study**
- Someone's before state
- What they did
- Results achieved
- Lessons for the reader

### 3. Sales/Conversion Sequence

**Purpose:** Convert leads into customers during a promotional period.

**Trigger:** Launch window, promo period, or behavior-based

**Length:** 5-12 emails over 5-14 days

**Goals:**
- Present the offer compellingly
- Handle objections
- Create urgency
- Drive purchase

**Typical Structure:**

| Day | Email | Focus |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 1 | Announcement | The offer is live + what it is |
| 2 | Benefits Deep-Dive | What they'll get/achieve |
| 3 | Story/Case Study | Proof it works |
| 4 | Objection Handling | Address concerns |
| 5 | FAQ | Answer common questions |
| 6 | Social Proof | More testimonials/results |
| 7 | Last Chance | Urgency + final push |
| 8 | Final Hours | Deadline reminder |

**Key Principles:**

**Vary the angle:** Each email should present the offer differently—benefits, story, proof, urgency, etc.

**Acknowledge the repetition:** "I know I've been emailing a lot..."

**Give value alongside selling:** Even sales emails can include useful content.

**Create real scarcity:** Deadlines, limited spots, price increases. (Don't fake it.)

### 4. Launch Sequence

**Purpose:** Build anticipation and convert during a product launch.

**Trigger:** Scheduled launch date

**Length:** Pre-launch (3-7 days) + Launch (5-10 days)

**Goals:**
- Build anticipation
- Educate on the problem
- Position the solution
- Drive purchases in launch window

**Two-Phase Structure:**

**Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Warm-Up)**
- Email 1: The big problem (no solution yet)
- Email 2: Hint at what's coming
- Email 3: Behind-the-scenes / story
- Email 4: What to expect + save the date

**Phase 2: Launch**
- Email 1: It's live + full details
- Email 2: Why I created this
- Email 3: Who it's for (and who it's not)
- Email 4: Deep dive on key benefit
- Email 5: Case study/testimonial
- Email 6: FAQ + objection handling
- Email 7: Last chance (24-48 hours)
- Email 8: Final hours

**Launch Psychology:**
- Create a "moment" people don't want to miss
- Build FOMO through countdown
- Stack value throughout sequence
- End strong with urgency

### 5. Onboarding Sequence

**Purpose:** Help new customers succeed with their purchase.

**Trigger:** Purchase/signup

**Length:** 5-10 emails over 14-30 days

**Goals:**
- Reduce buyer's remorse
- Ensure they use the product
- Drive quick wins
- Prevent churn
- Upsell/cross-sell later

**Structure:**

| Email | Timing | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Immediate | Welcome + what to do first |
| 2 | Day 2 | Quick win tutorial |
| 3 | Day 5 | Common mistake to avoid |
| 4 | Day 8 | Success story inspiration |
| 5 | Day 12 | Advanced tip |
| 6 | Day 20 | Check-in + support |
| 7 | Day 30 | Upsell or next steps |

**Key Principles:**
- Guide them to first success FAST
- Reduce friction and confusion
- Celebrate their progress
- Be available for questions

### 6. Re-Engagement Sequence

**Purpose:** Win back inactive subscribers or customers.

**Trigger:** No opens/clicks for 60-90 days

**Length:** 3-5 emails over 7-14 days

**Goals:**
- Re-activate interested subscribers
- Clean list of uninterested ones
- Learn why they disengaged

**Structure:**

**Email 1: "We miss you"**
- Subject: Personal, curious
- Body: "Haven't seen you in a while..."
- CTA: Here's what you missed

**Email 2: Best content roundup**
- Subject: Value-focused
- Body: Top content since they disengaged
- CTA: Dive back in

**Email 3: Direct ask**
- Subject: "Still interested?"
- Body: Be honest about checking in
- CTA: Click to stay / update preferences

**Email 4: Final notice**
- Subject: "Should I remove you?"
- Body: Last chance to stay
- CTA: Stay on list (removes if no action)

**Why this matters:** Inactive subscribers hurt deliverability. Better to have a smaller, engaged list.

## Writing Sequence Emails

### Subject Lines

**Open rate is everything.** If they don't open, nothing else matters.

**Formulas that work:**
- Question: "Are you making this mistake?"
- Curiosity gap: "The thing no one tells you about [topic]"
- Specific benefit: "How to get [result] in [timeframe]"
- Personal: "Can I ask you something?"
- Story hook: "She was about to give up when..."
- Direct: "[Topic] tips inside"

**What to avoid:**
- Clickbait that doesn't deliver
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
- Spam trigger words
- Generic ("Newsletter #47")

### Email Body Structure

**The Hook (First Line)**
Open with something that pulls them in. Start mid-story, ask a question, make a bold statement.

**The Body**
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- One idea per paragraph
- Conversational tone
- "You" more than "I"

**The Close**
- Clear CTA
- Single ask (don't confuse)
- PS line for important points (people read PS)

### The One Goal Rule

Every email should have ONE primary goal.

- One topic
- One CTA
- One action you want them to take

Multiple goals = confused readers = no action.

## Sequence Mechanics

### Triggers and Timing

**Time-based triggers:**
- Day 1, Day 3, Day 5...
- Best for: Welcome sequences, launches

**Behavior-based triggers:**
- Opened email → send next
- Clicked link → send follow-up
- Didn't open → send reminder
- Best for: Sophisticated nurture, sales sequences

**Event-based triggers:**
- Purchase → onboarding
- Cart abandonment → recovery
- No activity 60 days → re-engagement

### Sequence Mapping

Before writing, map the sequence:

1. Define the goal (what action do you want?)
2. Identify the trigger (what starts it?)
3. List emails needed (how many touchpoints?)
4. Define each email's purpose
5. Set timing between emails
6. Plan exit conditions (when do they leave the sequence?)

### Testing and Optimization

**What to test:**
- Subject lines (biggest impact)
- Send times
- Email length
- CTA placement
- Number of emails in sequence

**Key metrics:**
- Open rate (subject line effectiveness)
- Click rate (content + CTA effectiveness)
- Conversion rate (overall sequence effectiveness)
- Unsubscribe rate (content relevance)

---

## Common Sequence Mistakes

**Too many emails too fast:** Give people time to consume before sending more.

**No value before selling:** Build trust first, sell second.

**Generic content:** Personalize based on how they joined, what they clicked, etc.

**Missing the emotional arc:** Sequences should feel like a journey, not random emails.

**Weak CTAs:** Be specific about what you want them to do.

**No exit strategy:** People should leave sequences when they convert or disengage.

---

## Output

When asked to write email sequences, produce:

1. **Sequence map** — Email topics, purposes, and timing
2. **Full email copy** — Subject line, body, CTA for each email
3. **Trigger recommendation** — What starts the sequence
4. **Exit conditions** — When/how people leave the sequence
5. **Testing suggestions** — What to A/B test first

Include strategic reasoning for email order, timing, and content choices.
