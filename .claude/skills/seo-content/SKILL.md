# SEO Content

Articles that rank in search AND sound human. Structure for search engines, voice for people.

---

## The Dual Audience Problem

Every piece of SEO content has two audiences:
1. **Search engines** — algorithms that decide if you rank
2. **Humans** — people who decide if you're worth reading

Most SEO content optimizes for one and fails the other.

Over-optimized content ranks but reads like a robot wrote it. Visitors bounce, Google notices, rankings drop.

Under-optimized content sounds great but never gets found. It sits on page 7 forever.

The goal is content that satisfies both—structured enough for algorithms to understand, human enough for readers to enjoy.

## Understanding Search Intent

Before writing anything, understand WHY someone searches.

### The Four Intent Types

| Intent | What They Want | Content Type |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Informational | Learn something | Guides, tutorials, explanations |
| Navigational | Find a specific page | Brand pages, product pages |
| Commercial | Research before buying | Comparisons, reviews, "best X" |
| Transactional | Buy/do something now | Product pages, signup pages |

### How to Identify Intent

1. Google your target keyword
2. Look at what's ranking
3. Note the format (listicle, guide, comparison, etc.)
4. Note the angle (beginner vs. advanced, quick vs. comprehensive)

**Match the intent.** If the top 10 results are all listicles, don't write an essay. If they're all beginner guides, don't write an advanced deep-dive.

### Intent Signals in Keywords

- "How to..." → Informational (tutorial)
- "Best..." → Commercial (comparison)
- "Buy..." → Transactional
- "What is..." → Informational (definition)
- "[Brand name]" → Navigational
- "...vs..." → Commercial (comparison)
- "...review" → Commercial (evaluation)

## The Article Architecture

### The Inverted Pyramid

Put the most important information first. Readers (and Google) should understand your main point immediately.

**Structure:**
1. Answer the query in the intro
2. Expand with details
3. Add supporting information
4. Include related topics

Don't bury the answer. If someone asks "how long does it take to learn Python," your first paragraph should include a timeframe.

### Heading Hierarchy

```
H1: Main topic (one per page)
  H2: Major subtopic
    H3: Supporting point
    H3: Supporting point
  H2: Major subtopic
    H3: Supporting point
```

**H1 rules:**
- One H1 per page
- Include primary keyword
- Match search intent

**H2 rules:**
- Use for major sections
- Include secondary keywords naturally
- Make them scannable (readers skim headings)

**H3 rules:**
- Use for subsections within H2s
- Support the H2 topic
- Can target long-tail variations

### The Featured Snippet Formula

Google pulls featured snippets from content that answers questions directly and concisely.

**For definition snippets:**
- Use the format: "[Term] is [definition]"
- Keep it under 50 words
- Place directly after the relevant heading

**For list snippets:**
- Use clear numbered or bulleted lists
- Start each item with the key point
- Include 5-8 items (Google often truncates)

**For how-to snippets:**
- Number your steps
- Start each step with an action verb
- Keep steps concise and scannable

## Writing for Humans First

### The Voice Problem

SEO content often sounds robotic because writers prioritize keywords over readability.

**Signs of over-optimization:**
- Awkward keyword insertions
- Repetitive phrasing
- Generic filler paragraphs
- No personality or perspective

**The fix:** Write for humans first, optimize second. Get the information right, make it readable, then check keyword coverage.

### Making Content Readable

**Sentence length:** Vary it. Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones. But keep average length under 20 words.

**Paragraph length:** 2-4 sentences max. Online readers scan, not read. White space is your friend.

**Reading level:** Aim for 6th-8th grade level. Use Hemingway Editor to check. Complex topics can still use simple language.

**Active voice:** "The team completed the project" not "The project was completed by the team."

### Adding Value Beyond the SERP

Why should someone read YOUR article instead of the 10 others ranking for the same term?

**Differentiation tactics:**
- Original data or research
- Real examples and case studies
- Personal experience and lessons learned
- Unique frameworks or methodologies
- Better visuals and diagrams
- More comprehensive coverage
- More actionable steps
- Contrarian or nuanced perspectives

**The content gap question:** What's missing from the top 10 results that readers actually need?

## Keyword Integration

### Primary Keyword Placement

Include your primary keyword in:
- **Title (H1)** — Preferably near the beginning
- **URL** — Keep it short and clean
- **First 100 words** — Signal relevance early
- **Meta description** — For click-through, not ranking
- **At least one H2** — If natural

### Secondary Keywords

These are related terms and variations. Include them naturally throughout the content.

**Finding secondary keywords:**
- "People also ask" questions
- Related searches at bottom of SERP
- Competitor content analysis
- Keyword tools (Ahrefs, SEMrush, etc.)

### Semantic Relevance

Google understands topics, not just exact keywords. Cover the topic comprehensively by including related concepts, entities, and terminology.

**For an article on "email marketing":**
- Related concepts: open rates, click-through rates, automation, segmentation
- Related entities: Mailchimp, ConvertKit, email service providers
- Related terminology: drip campaigns, newsletters, list building

**Don't keyword stuff.** Include terms because they're relevant to the topic, not because you're trying to rank for them all.

## The Content Creation Process

### Step 1: Research the SERP

Before writing:
1. Google your keyword
2. Open the top 5-10 results
3. Analyze:
   - Content format (list, guide, comparison)
   - Content length (word count)
   - Subtopics covered
   - Depth of coverage
   - Content gaps

### Step 2: Create an Outline

Build a heading structure that:
- Matches search intent
- Covers all major subtopics from top results
- Fills content gaps you identified
- Flows logically for readers

### Step 3: Write the Draft

Write in this order:
1. **Body content** — Work through your outline
2. **Introduction** — Easier to write once you know the content
3. **Conclusion** — Summarize and add CTA
4. **Title/H1** — Refine after content is complete
5. **Meta description** — Write for clicks, not SEO

### Step 4: Optimize

After the draft is complete:
- Check keyword coverage (primary + secondary)
- Verify heading hierarchy
- Add internal links to related content
- Add external links to authoritative sources
- Optimize images (alt text, file names, compression)
- Check readability score
- Add schema markup if applicable

### Step 5: Format for Scannability

- Break up long paragraphs
- Add subheadings every 300 words
- Use bullet points for lists
- Bold key phrases (don't overdo it)
- Add relevant images/diagrams
- Include a table of contents for long content
