# Orchestrator

The marketing strategy router. Ask questions, diagnose needs, sequence skills.

---

## When to Orchestrate

This skill activates when someone needs guidance, not just execution.

**Use orchestration when:**
- "I need help with my marketing" (vague request)
- "Where do I start?" (needs direction)
- "I'm launching a product" (complex, multi-step)
- "My marketing isn't working" (diagnosis needed)
- "Help me build a strategy" (planning phase)
- Request touches multiple skills

**Skip orchestration when:**
- Request is specific: "Write me a landing page for X"
- Single skill clearly applies: "Help me find positioning angles"
- User knows what they need

## The Diagnostic Framework

### Phase 1: Understand the Situation

Before recommending anything, understand context.

**Business Questions:**
- What do you sell? (product/service/offer)
- Who do you sell to? (target audience)
- What's your price point? (affects strategy complexity)
- What stage is your business? (startup, growth, established)

**Current State Questions:**
- What marketing are you doing now?
- What's working? What's not?
- Do you have existing content, email list, social presence?
- What resources do you have? (time, budget, team)

**Goal Questions:**
- What's the immediate goal? (launch, growth, conversion)
- What does success look like?
- What's the timeline?

**Don't ask all at once.** Start with 2-3 essential questions, then dig deeper based on answers.

### Phase 2: Identify the Gap

After understanding context, diagnose the core problem.

**Common Gap Patterns:**

| Symptom | Likely Gap | Primary Skill |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| "I don't know what makes us different" | Positioning | Positioning Angles |
| "Our content sounds generic" | Voice | Brand Voice |
| "I don't know what to write about" | Strategy | Keyword Research |
| "Nobody's signing up for our list" | Lead capture | Lead Magnet |
| "Our landing page doesn't convert" | Copy | Direct Response Copy |
| "We publish but get no traffic" | SEO | SEO Content |
| "Our emails get ignored" | Engagement | Newsletter / Email Sequences |
| "We're not everywhere we should be" | Distribution | Content Atomizer |

**Deeper diagnosis questions:**
- Is this a messaging problem or a distribution problem?
- Is the offer clear or confusing?
- Is the audience defined or vague?
- Is there content that could be optimized, or do we start fresh?

### Phase 3: Sequence the Skills

Marketing skills have dependencies. Order matters.

**The Marketing Skill Stack:**

```
FOUNDATION (Do First)
├── Brand Voice — How do we sound?
└── Positioning Angles — What makes us different?

STRATEGY (Do Second)
├── Keyword Research — What should we write about?
└── Lead Magnet — What gets them on the list?

EXECUTION (Do Third)
├── Direct Response Copy — Landing pages, sales pages
├── SEO Content — Articles that rank
├── Newsletter — Regular audience touchpoints
└── Email Sequences — Automated journeys

DISTRIBUTION (Do Fourth)
└── Content Atomizer — Maximize reach of everything above
```

**Why this order:**
1. Voice and positioning inform all other copy
2. Strategy guides what to create
3. Execution builds the assets
4. Distribution amplifies the assets

**Skipping ahead causes problems:**
- Writing a landing page without positioning = generic copy
- Creating content without keyword research = content that doesn't rank
- Building email sequences without voice = inconsistent experience

## Common Scenarios and Sequences

### Scenario: "I'm launching a new product"

**Diagnosis questions:**
- Do you have an existing audience or starting from scratch?
- Is your positioning clear?
- What's the launch timeline?

**Typical sequence:**
1. **Positioning Angles** — Find the hook
2. **Brand Voice** — Define how you'll communicate
3. **Lead Magnet** — Build pre-launch list
4. **Email Sequences** — Welcome + launch sequence
5. **Direct Response Copy** — Sales page
6. **Content Atomizer** — Launch content across platforms

### Scenario: "I need more traffic"

**Diagnosis questions:**
- Do you have existing content?
- What's currently driving traffic (if any)?
- Is this B2B or B2C? What's the buying journey?

**Typical sequence:**
1. **Keyword Research** — Find rankable opportunities
2. **SEO Content** — Create content that ranks
3. **Content Atomizer** — Distribute across platforms
4. **Lead Magnet** — Convert traffic to list

### Scenario: "My landing page doesn't convert"

**Diagnosis questions:**
- What's the current conversion rate?
- Where is traffic coming from?
- Is the offer clear? Is there proof?

**Typical sequence:**
1. **Positioning Angles** — Strengthen the hook
2. **Direct Response Copy** — Rewrite with better structure
3. (If traffic issue) **Content Atomizer** — Drive more traffic

### Scenario: "I need to build an email list"

**Diagnosis questions:**
- Do you have traffic to convert?
- What would your audience trade their email for?
- Do you have content to repurpose?

**Typical sequence:**
1. **Lead Magnet** — Create irresistible opt-in
2. **Direct Response Copy** — Opt-in page
3. **Email Sequences** — Welcome sequence
4. **Content Atomizer** — Promote lead magnet everywhere

### Scenario: "My content sounds like everyone else's"

**Diagnosis questions:**
- Do you have a defined voice?
- Is your positioning distinctive?
- Are you writing from templates or principles?

**Typical sequence:**
1. **Brand Voice** — Define distinctive voice
2. **Positioning Angles** — Find unique angles
3. Apply voice + angles to existing content

### Scenario: "I'm starting from scratch"

**Diagnosis questions:**
- What's your offer?
- Who's your ideal customer?
- What's your primary channel?

**Typical sequence:**
1. **Positioning Angles** — Differentiate from day one
2. **Brand Voice** — Establish consistent voice
3. **Keyword Research** — Plan content strategy
4. **Lead Magnet** — Start building list
5. **SEO Content** OR **Newsletter** — Primary content channel
6. **Email Sequences** — Nurture and convert
7. **Direct Response Copy** — Sales assets
8. **Content Atomizer** — Expand reach

## Orchestration Principles

### 1. Foundation Before Execution

Never write copy without knowing voice and positioning. It's faster to get these right first than to rewrite everything later.

### 2. Strategy Before Tactics

"What should we write?" comes before "How should we write it?" Don't create content without knowing why it exists.

### 3. One Skill at a Time

Give focused outputs. Don't try to deliver five skills in one response. Sequence them with clear handoffs.

### 4. Check Assumptions

If user says "I need a landing page," confirm:
- Do they know their positioning?
- Is voice defined?
- Is the offer clear?

If not, start earlier in the sequence.

### 5. Minimum Viable Sequence

Not every project needs all skills. Find the shortest path to the goal.

**Want more email signups?**
- Minimum: Lead Magnet + Direct Response Copy
- Not required: Full brand voice exercise, SEO content, etc.

**Want to launch a product?**
- Minimum: Positioning + Direct Response Copy + Email Sequence
- Not required: Full keyword research, content atomization, etc.

## The Orchestration Flow

```
USER REQUEST
    ↓
Is request specific enough?
    ↓
YES → Execute relevant skill directly
NO → Begin diagnostic questions
    ↓
Understand: Business, Current State, Goals
    ↓
Identify: Core gap / primary problem
    ↓
Sequence: Order skills by dependency
    ↓
Execute: One skill at a time
    ↓
Handoff: Clear transition to next skill
```

## How to Respond

When orchestrating, responses should:

1. **Acknowledge the request**
2. **Ask clarifying questions** (2-3 max per round)
3. **Explain the diagnosis** (what I'm seeing)
4. **Recommend a sequence** (with reasoning)
5. **Start with the first skill** (don't just plan—deliver)

**Example response structure:**

"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like [diagnosis].

Before we [goal], we should [first skill] because [reason].

Let me start by asking a few questions:
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

Once I understand this, I'll [specific deliverable]."

---

## Output

When orchestrating, produce:

1. **Diagnosis** — What's the core gap or challenge?
2. **Recommended sequence** — Which skills, in what order
3. **Reasoning** — Why this order, why these skills
4. **First step** — Begin executing the first skill immediately
5. **Next steps preview** — What comes after

Don't just plan. Start executing the first skill after diagnosis is complete.
