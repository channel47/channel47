  Create landing page copy that converts. Two modes: (1) Direct Response for service pages and sales-driven opt-ins using PAS/AIDA/Cialdini frameworks, (2) Founder Journey for story-driven pages, building-in-public, open source projects, and community opt-ins where narrative and authenticity drive conversion. Use when: building landing pages, writing sales pages, creating opt-in pages, newsletter signups, open source project pages, or any page designed to convert visitors to action.

# Conversion Copywriter

Two ways to convert. Pick the right one.

**Direct Response Mode**: Pain-driven. Structured sections. Works when the problem is acute and the solution is clear. Service pages, lead magnets, course sales.

**Founder Journey Mode**: Story-driven. Narrative flow. Works when the person behind the offer IS the offer. Building-in-public, open source, community, newsletter opt-ins.

Most pages are one or the other. Some blend both. The key is knowing which engine drives the conversion.

---

## Mode Selection

Before writing anything, determine which mode fits:

| Signal | Mode |
|--------|------|
| Selling a service with clear outcomes | Direct Response |
| Audience knows they have a problem | Direct Response |
| Price is a factor in the decision | Direct Response |
| The founder's story IS the value prop | Founder Journey |
| Building community, not selling product | Founder Journey |
| Open source, free tools, movement-building | Founder Journey |
| "Join my journey" energy | Founder Journey |
| Audience doesn't know they need this yet | Founder Journey |

**Hybrid approach**: Some pages use Founder Journey to build relationship, then Direct Response at the conversion moment. Origin story flows into clear offer with structured proof.

---

## Direct Response Mode

For pages where pain and solution drive the conversion.

### Discovery

**Always need:**
- What's the offer?
- What action should visitors take?
- Who's the ideal customer?
- What's the main pain point?

**Ask if unclear:**
- What makes this different?
- Any proof elements?
- Objections prospects raise?

### Framework Selection

**PAS** (Problem-Agitate-Solution): Best when pain is acute. Name it, twist it, solve it.

**AIDA** (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action): Best for new/unfamiliar offers. Pattern interrupt, build want, ask.

**StoryBrand**: Best when transformation is the sell. Customer is hero, you're the guide.

See [references/frameworks.md](references/frameworks.md) for detailed application.

### Structure

Hero, Problem, Solution, How It Works, Proof, Offer, FAQ, Final CTA

Adjust based on proof availability and offer complexity.

### Voice

Direct. Punchy. Confident. Short sentences. Bold claims backed by specifics.

- Lead with outcomes, not features
- "You" more than "we"
- One idea per sentence
- Specific beats vague ("47 clients" not "many")

### Output Format

```markdown
# [Page Title]

> **Mode:** Direct Response
> **Framework:** [PAS/AIDA/StoryBrand]
> **Influence levers:** [2-3 from Cialdini]

## Founder Journey Mode

For pages where narrative and authenticity drive the conversion.

This mode exists because direct response frameworks fail when:
- The offer is free (no purchase objection to overcome)
- The value is the relationship, not the product
- The founder's worldview IS the differentiation
- You're building a movement, not closing a sale

### Discovery

**Always need:**
- What's the origin story? (How did you get here?)
- What do you believe that others don't?
- What are you building, and why does it matter?
- What's the invitation? (Not "what's the CTA" - what are you inviting them into?)

**Ask if unclear:**
- What's one specific moment that shows this working?
- Who is this NOT for?
- What happens after they join?

### The Founder Journey Framework

Stories persuade by transporting readers. When someone is inside your story, they're not counterarguing. They're along for the ride.

**Structure** (Pixar formula adapted):

1. **Once upon a time...** - Where you started. The world before.
2. **Every day...** - The status quo. What was normal.
3. **Until one day...** - The inciting incident. What changed.
4. **Because of that...** - The journey. What you discovered, built, learned.
5. **Until finally...** - Where you are now. What exists because of the journey.
6. **And now...** - The invitation. What they can be part of.

This isn't a rigid template. It's a current that pulls readers forward.

### Voice

Conversational. First-person. Reads like a person, not a brand.

The test: Read it aloud. Does it sound like talking or performing?

**Do:**
- Write like you're explaining to one person
- Share the real numbers with context
- Admit what you don't know
- Let personality show

**Don't:**
- Perform vulnerability (struggles that are actually humble-brags)
- Crop the story to only show wins
- Use "we" when you mean "I"
- Sound like a LinkedIn post

### Authenticity Principles

The effort must appear effortless. If readers can smell the performance, you've lost them.

**Real authenticity:**
- Shares progress AND setbacks
- Numbers come with context (not just revenue, but margins, costs, bad months)
- Admits limitations and who it's not for
- The ask feels like an invitation, not a conversion mechanism

**Performative authenticity (avoid):**
- Crying on camera while selling
- "My biggest struggle was too much growth"
- Carefully cropped metrics
- Values stated but not lived

### Structure

Founder Journey pages flow as narrative, not sections. But they still need scaffolding:

1. **Hook**: A specific moment, surprising fact, or bold claim that earns the next sentence
2. **Origin**: How you got here (compressed, not comprehensive)
3. **The Build**: What you're creating and why it matters
4. **Proof of Life**: One concrete example that shows this working
5. **The Belief**: What you stand for. The worldview.
6. **The Invitation**: What they can join. One clear action.

### Output Format

```markdown
# [Page Title]

> **Mode:** Founder Journey
> **Core belief:** [The worldview driving this]
> **Invitation:** [What you're asking them to join]

---

[Opening hook - 1-2 sentences that earn attention]

[Origin story - how you got here, compressed]

[The build - what exists now, what you're creating]

[Proof moment - one specific example]

[The belief - what you stand for]

[The invitation - clear, single ask]

---

**[CTA Button Text]**

[What happens next - reduce uncertainty]
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

Read [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) before finalizing.

**Both modes:**
- AI writing tells (em dashes, "unlock," "I hope this finds you well")
- Multiple competing CTAs
- Features without transformation
- Vague claims ("many," "significant," "best-in-class")

**Direct Response specific:**
- Fake scarcity
- Manufactured urgency
- Pain exaggeration

**Founder Journey specific:**
- Performative vulnerability
- Cropped success metrics
- LinkedIn Lunatic energy (toxic positivity, weaponized optimism)
- Philosophy without proof
- Story without invitation

---

## When to Blend Modes

Some pages need both engines.

**Pattern**: Founder Journey opening (build relationship, establish worldview) into Direct Response close (structured proof, clear offer, urgency if real).

Example flow:
1. Origin story (Founder Journey)
2. What I built (Founder Journey)
3. How it works (Direct Response structure)
4. Results (Direct Response proof)
5. The belief (Founder Journey)
6. The offer (Direct Response CTA)

The blend works when the story earns the right to sell.
