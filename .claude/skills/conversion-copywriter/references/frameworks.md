## 1. PAS Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

Best for: Audiences who already know they have a problem but haven't found the right solution.

### Structure

**Problem** - Name the pain clearly. Be specific. Use their language.
"You're spending 10+ hours a week on proposals that don't close."

**Agitate** - Twist the knife. Show the cost of inaction. Make the status quo uncomfortable.
"Every month that passes, you're leaving $20K on the table. Your competitors are closing deals you should have won."

**Solution** - Position your offer as the obvious answer.
"Our proposal system cuts creation time to 30 minutes and doubles your close rate."

### Application Pattern

```
Hero: Problem statement as headline
Section 2: Agitate with specifics and stakes
Section 3: Introduce solution
Remaining sections: Prove it works, show how, make the offer
```

## 2. AIDA Framework (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

Best for: New offers, unfamiliar audiences, or when problem awareness is low.

### Structure

**Attention** - Pattern interrupt. Say something unexpected. Stop the scroll.
"What if your next client paid you before you started working?"

**Interest** - Introduce a new possibility. Connect to what they want.
"Retainer-first consulting eliminates scope creep and guarantees your income."

**Desire** - Paint the picture. Make them want it. Show transformation.
"Imagine knowing exactly what you'll earn next month. No chasing invoices. No awkward money conversations."

**Action** - Clear next step. Remove friction. Create urgency.
"Book your strategy call today. Only 3 spots open this month."

### Application Pattern

```
Hero: Attention-grabbing headline + Interest hook in subhead
Section 2-3: Build Interest with "what if" and "imagine"
Section 4-5: Desire through proof and transformation stories
Final sections: Action with clear CTA and urgency
```

## 3. StoryBrand Framework

Best for: Complex offers, relationship-based services, premium positioning.

### The 7-Part Story Structure

1. **Character** - Your customer is the hero, not you
2. **Problem** - External, internal, and philosophical dimensions
3. **Guide** - You appear as the mentor (empathy + authority)
4. **Plan** - Give them a simple path (3 steps max)
5. **Call to Action** - Direct and transitional CTAs
6. **Failure** - What they avoid by working with you
7. **Success** - The transformation they achieve

### Problem Layers

- **External** - The surface problem (visible, tangible)
- **Internal** - How it makes them feel (frustrated, embarrassed, stuck)
- **Philosophical** - Why it's wrong (shouldn't be this hard, deserve better)

### Application Pattern

```
Hero: Character-focused headline ("You deserve X")
Section 2: Three layers of problem
Section 3: Guide introduction (empathy + credentials)
Section 4: The plan (3 simple steps)
Section 5: Stakes (failure avoided + success achieved)
Final: Direct CTA
```

## 4. Cialdini's Influence Principles

Weave 2-3 of these throughout the page. Don't force all six.

### Reciprocity
Give value first. Free guides, insights, tools.
"Download our free calculator before you book a call."

### Scarcity
Limited availability creates urgency. Must be true.
"Only accepting 5 new clients this quarter."

### Authority
Credentials, experience, media, results.
"Featured in Forbes. 200+ clients served. 15 years in the industry."

### Consistency
Get small yeses before big ones.
"If you've read this far, you're serious about growth."

### Liking
Be human. Show personality. Find common ground.
"I was exactly where you are 5 years ago."

### Social Proof
Testimonials, logos, numbers, case studies.
"Join 2,000+ marketers who've doubled their conversion rates."

- **StoryBrand + AIDA**: Use StoryBrand story arc, AIDA for individual sections
- **AIDA + PAS**: AIDA for hero, PAS for body sections
