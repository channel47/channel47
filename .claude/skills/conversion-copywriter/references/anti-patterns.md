**Overly parallel structure**
- Bad: "Save time. Save money. Save your sanity."
- Good: "Cut your time in half. Keep more profit. Actually enjoy the work."

## 2. Sleazy Tactics (Direct Response)

Persuasion should feel like help, not manipulation.

### Fake Scarcity
- Don't: "Only 3 spots left!" (when there are unlimited)
- Don't: Countdown timers that reset
- Don't: "Price goes up at midnight!" (if it doesn't)
- Do: Use real scarcity when it exists. Explain why.

### Fake Social Proof
- Don't: Made-up testimonials
- Don't: Stock photo "customers"
- Don't: Inflated numbers ("10,000+ served" when it's 200)
- Do: Use real quotes, real photos, real numbers.

### Fear Manipulation
- Don't: "You'll fail without this"
- Don't: Catastrophizing consequences
- Don't: Making people feel broken or inadequate
- Do: Acknowledge pain honestly. Position solution as help, not rescue.

### Bait and Switch
- Don't: Promise X, deliver Y
- Don't: Bury important terms
- Don't: "Free" with hidden requirements
- Do: Be upfront about what they get and what it costs.

### Pressure Tactics
- Don't: "Decide now or lose this forever"
- Don't: Manufactured urgency
- Don't: Guilt-based CTAs
- Do: Confident invitation. Let the offer stand on its own.

## 3. Performative Authenticity (Founder Journey)

The deadliest anti-pattern for story-driven copy. If readers smell the performance, you've lost them.

### The LinkedIn Lunatic Pattern

Toxic positivity. Weaponized optimism. Every setback is a "learning opportunity." Every failure is "actually the best thing that happened to me."

**Signs you're doing it:**
- Every story has a tidy lesson
- Struggles are actually humble-brags in disguise
- The energy feels like motivational poster quotes
- You're performing vulnerability, not sharing it

**Example (bad):**
> "I got fired from my dream job. Best thing that ever happened to me. Within 6 months I'd 10x'd my income and found my true calling. If you're going through something hard right now, trust the process."

**Example (better):**
> "I got fired. It sucked. I spent three months applying to jobs that didn't want me. Eventually I started freelancing out of necessity, not vision. It worked out, but I'm not going to pretend I had some master plan."

### Cropped Metrics

Sharing numbers without context. Revenue screenshots that hide the costs. Growth charts that start after the plateau.

**Signs you're doing it:**
- Sharing revenue but not profit
- Showing growth but not the dip before it
- Celebrating milestones without mentioning what it took to get there

**Example (bad):**
> "Hit $50K MRR this month!"
> [Screenshot of Stripe dashboard]

**Example (better):**
> "Hit $50K MRR. Took 18 months and three pivots. Still burning cash because CAC is too high. Working on it."

### Philosophy Without Proof

Big beliefs with no evidence they're lived. Values stated, not demonstrated.

**Signs you're doing it:**
- Lots of "I believe" statements
- Mission-speak without specific examples
- Claims about what you stand for without showing what you've done

**Example (bad):**
> "I believe in radical transparency and putting community first. That's why I'm building this in public."

**Example (better):**
> "Here's our actual roadmap, including the features we killed because users didn't want them. Here's what we're struggling with right now. If you have ideas, I'm listening."

### Story Without Invitation

A great origin story that goes nowhere. Reader finishes and thinks "cool story" but doesn't know what to do next.

**Signs you're doing it:**
- The narrative ends without a clear ask
- Multiple CTAs competing for attention
- The action feels disconnected from the story

### Vulnerability as Marketing Tactic

Sharing personal struggles specifically because you know it will resonate. The calculation is visible.

**The test:** Would you share this if no one was watching?

If the answer is no, don't share it with an audience either.

## 4. Structural Problems

### Wall of Text
Every section needs visual breaks. Max 3-4 sentences before a break.

### Buried CTA
Don't make them scroll to find the action. CTA in hero. CTA after proof. CTA at end. Minimum three for Direct Response. One clear invitation for Founder Journey.

### Feature Dump
Listing features without connecting to outcomes. Always answer "so what?"

- Bad: "Includes 12 video modules"
- Good: "12 video modules. Watch on your commute. Implement the same day."

### Missing Stakes
If there's no consequence to inaction, there's no urgency to act. Name what they're leaving on the table.

### Weak Headlines
Headlines carry 80% of the weight. Test them by asking: Would I click this? Does it promise something specific?

- Bad: "Welcome to Our Services"
- Bad: "We Help Businesses Grow"
- Good: "Double Your Pipeline in 90 Days"

### Multiple Competing CTAs
One page, one action. If you're asking them to subscribe AND follow AND download AND share, you're asking for nothing.

## 5. Voice and Tone Mistakes

### Corporate Speak
- Bad: "We provide solutions that enable businesses to optimize their outcomes."
- Good: "We help you close more deals."

### Trying Too Hard
- Bad: "AMAZING results! You won't BELIEVE what happens next!"
- Good: Let the results speak. Confidence over hype.

### Vague Claims
- Bad: "Significant improvements"
- Bad: "Many satisfied customers"
- Good: "47% increase in 30 days"
- Good: "214 clients since 2019"

### Self-Focused Copy
- Bad: "We're proud to offer..."
- Bad: "Our team of experts..."
- Good: "You get..."
- Good: "Your results include..."

Count the "you" vs "we" ratio. Aim for 3:1 or higher in Direct Response. Founder Journey can use more "I" but should still focus on what the reader gets.

### Inconsistent Tone
Pick a voice and stick with it. Don't swing from casual to formal mid-page.

### "We" When You Mean "I"
If you're a solo founder, say "I." Using "we" to sound bigger is the opposite of authentic.
