## 3. Founder Journey: Story Page

For building-in-public, newsletter opt-ins, community pages where narrative drives conversion.

**Key difference from Direct Response:** This page flows as prose, not chunked sections. The structure is invisible scaffolding, not visible boxes.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              HOOK                       │
│  1-2 sentences that earn attention      │

│  specific moment that pulls reader in   │
│                                         │
│  NOT: "Welcome to my site"              │
│  NOT: Generic value proposition         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           ORIGIN STORY                  │
│  How you got here (compressed)          │
│  The "until one day" moment             │
│  What changed your trajectory           │
│                                         │
│  Keep it to 2-3 paragraphs max          │
│  Specific details > comprehensive recap │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            THE BUILD                    │
│  What exists now                        │
│  What you're creating                   │

│                                         │
│  This is where features live, but       │
│  framed through story, not bullets      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          PROOF OF LIFE                  │
│  One concrete example                   │
│  A specific moment that shows this      │
│  working in the real world              │
│                                         │
│  "Last week, I used this to..."         │
│  NOT: Testimonials (you may not have)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            THE BELIEF                   │
│  What you stand for                     │
│  The worldview driving this             │
│  Why you're giving this away / building │
│  in public / inviting others in         │
│                                         │
│  This is the soul of the page           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          THE INVITATION                 │
│  One clear action                       │
│  Framed as invitation, not conversion   │
│  What happens after they join           │
│                                         │
│  "If this resonates, join us"           │
│  NOT: "Sign up now before it's too late"│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Layout note:** Unlike Direct Response pages with clear visual sections, Founder Journey pages often work better as a single flowing column of text with generous whitespace. The sections above are invisible to the reader.

## 4. Founder Journey: Open Source / Community

For dev tools, open source projects, plugin marketplaces, community-driven products.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              HOOK                       │
│  What this thing DOES (clear, specific) │
│  One sentence that explains the tool    │
│                                         │

## 5. Section Library

Mix and match these sections as needed.

### Hero Section (Direct Response)

**Wireframe:** Full-width. Headline dominant. CTA above the fold.

**Pattern:**
```
[Outcome headline]
[Who + mechanism subhead]
[CTA button]
```

**Example:**
```
Close 50% More Deals Without Hiring Another Rep
A proven sales system for B2B teams that actually sticks.
[Book Your Strategy Call]
```

### Hook (Founder Journey)

**Wireframe:** Clean, minimal. Text-focused. No visual clutter.

**Pattern:**
```
[Surprising fact, specific moment, or bold claim]
[One sentence that earns the next paragraph]
```

**Example:**
```
I produce about 10,000 lines of code a day. I don't know how to code.

That sounds like a contradiction until you understand what Claude can do
when you stop thinking of it as a chatbot.
```

### Problem Section (Direct Response)

**Wireframe:** Text-focused. Optional icons for each pain point.

**Pattern:**
```
[Empathy headline: "Sound familiar?"]

[Pain point 1 - external]
[Pain point 2 - internal feeling]
[Pain point 3 - consequence]

[Agitation: what it costs them]
```

**Example:**
```
Sound familiar?

You're drowning in proposals that go nowhere.
Every "let me think about it" feels like a punch to the gut.
Meanwhile, revenue stays flat while costs keep climbing.

Every month this continues, you're leaving $30K+ on the table.
```

### Origin Story (Founder Journey)

**Wireframe:** Flowing prose. No headers. Reads like a letter.

**Pattern:**
```
[Where you started]
[What was normal]
[The moment everything changed]
[What you discovered]
```

**Example:**
```
A year ago I was clicking through the Google Ads UI like everyone else.
Twenty-five accounts. Hundreds of campaigns. The same repetitive checks,
day after day.

Then I started experimenting with Claude. Not for ads specifically. Just
curious what it could do. One day I asked it to write a script that would
pull campaign data. It worked. I asked for another. That worked too.

Within a few months, I'd moved my entire workflow into the terminal.
```

### Proof of Life (Founder Journey)

**Wireframe:** Specific, concrete, recent. Not polished case study.

**Pattern:**
```
[Specific recent example]
[What happened]
[The result]
```

**Example:**
```
Last week I asked Claude to audit eight accounts. Check every campaign,
every ad, every extension against RSA best practices. Find the gaps.
Suggest fixes. Make the changes.

It took under ten minutes. That same task used to take me a full day,
and I'd still miss things.
```

### The Belief (Founder Journey)

**Wireframe:** Set apart visually. This is the soul of the page.

**Pattern:**
```
[What you believe]
[Why you believe it]
[What you're doing about it]
```

**Example:**
```
I think intelligence is becoming a commodity. Maybe it already is.

What's valuable now isn't access to AI. It's knowing how to wield it.
The workflows, the prompts, the patterns that actually produce results.

That's why everything I build is open source. The tools are free.
What I'm asking for is your feedback. Use them. Break them. Tell me
what's missing. That's how they get better.
```

### The Invitation (Founder Journey)

**Wireframe:** Clear, singular ask. Not a conversion mechanism.

**Pattern:**
```
[What you're inviting them into]
[What they get]
[What you get]
[The action]
```

**Example:**
```
If any of this resonates, I'd like you to join us.

You'll get access to every plugin I build, plus a community of media
buyers figuring this stuff out together.

What I get is your honest feedback. That's the deal.

[Join the List]

You'll get an email when new tools drop. That's it. No spam.
```

### FAQ Section (Direct Response)

**Wireframe:** Accordion or simple Q&A list.

**Pattern:** Answer objections, not just questions.

**Common objections to address:**
- "What if it doesn't work for my situation?"
- "How long until I see results?"
- "What's the time commitment?"
- "What makes this different from X?"
- "What if I need to cancel?"

### Final CTA Section (Direct Response)

**Wireframe:** Centered. Recap value. Strong button.

**Pattern:**
```
[Transformation recap]
[Risk reversal or guarantee]
[CTA button]
[Micro-copy: what happens next]
```

**Example:**
```
Ready to stop leaving money on the table?

Book your free strategy call. If you don't walk away with at least
3 actionable ideas, I'll send you $100.

[Claim Your Spot]

You'll pick a time, answer 3 quick questions, and we'll talk for
30 minutes. No pitch. Just value.
```
