# Brand Voice

Define how a brand sounds. One file ensures every piece of copy matches the voice, not generic AI-speak.

---

## Why This Matters

Generic AI copy sounds like generic AI copy. It's competent, polished, and completely forgettable. The problem isn't bad writing—it's writing that could belong to anyone.

Voice is the difference between "We offer solutions for your business needs" and "We're the weird ones who think spreadsheets are beautiful."

When you nail voice, readers feel like they're talking to a person, not a brand. When you miss it, everything sounds like it was written by a committee of lawyers and MBAs.

## The Voice Extraction Process

Don't ask "What's your brand voice?" People give useless answers like "professional but friendly" or "approachable yet authoritative." Everyone says that.

Instead, extract voice from what already exists.

### Step 1: Gather Source Material

Ask for:
- Best-performing content (highest engagement, most shares, best conversion)
- Content the founder/team loves and thinks "sounds like us"
- Customer testimonials and reviews (how customers describe the brand)
- Internal communications that capture how the team actually talks
- Competitor content they hate (reveals what to avoid)

If no content exists yet, conduct a voice interview:
- "Describe your brand like it's a person at a party"
- "What would your brand never say?"
- "If your brand had a nemesis, who would it be?"
- "What's an opinion your brand has that might be controversial?"

### Step 2: Extract Voice Dimensions

Analyze the source material across these dimensions:

**Formality Spectrum**
Where does the brand sit?
- Casual → Conversational → Professional → Formal → Academic
- Example: "Hey, let's fix that" vs. "We'll address your concern" vs. "We shall endeavor to resolve the matter"

**Personality Traits**
Pick 3-4 that actually differentiate:
- Not "friendly" (everyone claims this)
- Instead: "irreverent," "obsessive," "provocative," "nerdy," "blunt"
- Each trait should have implications for how copy sounds

**Emotional Register**
What feeling does the brand evoke?
- Excitement, calm, urgency, warmth, intensity, playfulness
- Note: This isn't about what the brand wants to evoke—it's what actually comes through

**Vocabulary Patterns**
- Words they use frequently
- Words they never use
- Industry jargon: embrace or avoid?
- Contractions: yes or no?
- Sentence length: punchy or flowing?

**Point of View**
- First person singular (I/me) — personal, founder-led
- First person plural (we/us) — team-oriented
- Second person (you/your) — customer-focused
- Third person — more formal, institutional

### Step 3: Document Anti-Patterns

This is where most voice guides fail. They say what to do, not what to avoid.

For every trait, define the opposite:

| Voice Trait | Never Sound Like |
|-------------|------------------|
| Direct | Hedging, over-qualifying, passive voice |
| Playful | Trying too hard, forced jokes, cringe |
| Expert | Condescending, jargon-heavy, academic |
| Warm | Saccharine, fake enthusiasm, over-familiar |

Collect specific phrases to avoid:
- "Solutions for your needs"
- "We're passionate about..."
- "Best-in-class"
- "Synergy" (unless ironic)
- "Don't hesitate to reach out"

## The Voice Document Structure

A useful voice guide isn't a mood board. It's a working document that makes writing easier.

### Section 1: Voice Summary (1 paragraph)

Write this as if you're briefing a new copywriter in 60 seconds.

**Example:**
"We sound like the smartest person in the room who doesn't act like it. We're direct to the point of bluntness, but never mean. We use plain language to explain complex things. We're allowed to be funny, but we don't force it—the humor comes from unexpected honesty, not jokes. We never hedge or use corporate speak. If we're not sure about something, we say so directly."

### Section 2: Voice Attributes (3-4 traits with examples)

For each trait:
1. What it means
2. How it affects the writing
3. Example that demonstrates it
4. What NOT to do

**Example Attribute: Direct**

*What it means:* We say what we mean without padding. We respect our readers' time. We don't hedge or over-qualify.

*How it affects writing:* Lead with the point. Cut filler words. Use active voice. If there's a hard truth, say it.

*Example:*
- ✗ "We believe that it might be worth considering the possibility that..."
- ✓ "Here's what we think:"

*Anti-pattern:* Don't confuse direct with rude. "This is wrong" is direct. "Only an idiot would think this" is rude.

### Section 3: Vocabulary Guide

**Words We Use:**
- "Ship" instead of "launch"
- "Build" instead of "develop"
- "Customers" instead of "users"
- "Money" instead of "revenue"

**Words We Avoid:**
- "Leverage" (say "use")
- "Utilize" (say "use")
- "Innovative" (show, don't tell)
- "Seamless" (meaningless)
- "Robust" (meaningless)

**Phrases That Sound Like Us:**
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's be honest—"
- "The short version:"

**Phrases That Don't:**
- "We're excited to announce..."
- "Thank you for your interest..."
- "Please don't hesitate to..."

### Section 4: Grammar and Style Choices

- Contractions: Yes (we're, don't, can't)
- Oxford comma: Yes
- Sentence fragments: Allowed for emphasis
- Starting sentences with "And" or "But": Yes
- Exclamation points: Sparingly (max 1 per piece)
- Emojis: Context-dependent (social yes, docs no)

### Section 5: Context Variations

Voice stays consistent. Tone adapts to context.

| Context | Tone Adjustment |
|---------|-----------------|
| Error messages | More empathetic, less playful |
| Sales pages | More energetic, stronger conviction |
| Help docs | More patient, step-by-step |
| Social media | More casual, more personality |
| Legal/compliance | More formal, still human |

### Section 6: Before/After Examples

The most useful part of any voice guide.

**Website Hero**
- Before: "We provide innovative solutions that help businesses achieve their goals through cutting-edge technology."
- After: "We make software that actually works. No buzzwords, no complexity, just tools that help you sell more."

**Email Subject Line**
- Before: "Important Update Regarding Your Account"
- After: "Quick heads up about your account"

**Error Message**
- Before: "An error has occurred. Please try again later."
- After: "Something broke on our end. We're fixing it. Try again in a few minutes?"

**CTA Button**
- Before: "Submit"
- After: "Send it" / "Let's go" / "Count me in"

## Voice Consistency Checklist

Before publishing, ask:
- [ ] Could a competitor have written this? (If yes, revise)
- [ ] Would I read this out loud without cringing?
- [ ] Does this sound like a person or a brand?
- [ ] Did I use any banned words/phrases?
- [ ] Is this the right tone for the context?
- [ ] Would the founder/team recognize this as "us"?

## Common Voice Problems and Fixes

**Problem: Sounds like everyone else**
Fix: Add specificity. Instead of "We care about quality," say "We rejected 47 prototypes before shipping this."

**Problem: Trying too hard to be quirky**
Fix: Dial it back. Personality comes from consistency and small choices, not forced quirkiness in every sentence.

**Problem: Inconsistent across channels**
Fix: The voice doesn't change—only the volume. Social can be louder, legal can be quieter, but the underlying personality stays the same.

**Problem: Different writers sound different**
Fix: The voice doc needs more examples, not more rules. Show, don't tell.

**Problem: Voice disappears under pressure**
Fix: When deadlines hit, writers default to safe corporate speak. Build review processes that catch voice drift.
