# Keyword Research

Strategic content planning without expensive tools. The 6 Circles Method finds what to write about and prioritizes it.

---

## Why Most Keyword Research Fails

People open a keyword tool, export 10,000 keywords, sort by volume, and start writing about whatever's biggest.

This is backwards.

High-volume keywords are high-volume because everyone's already writing about them. You're competing against sites with decades of authority and teams of writers. The math doesn't work.

Smart keyword research isn't about finding the most-searched terms. It's about finding the intersection of what you can rank for, what your audience needs, and what moves your business forward.

## The 6 Circles Method

Imagine six overlapping circles. Good content topics sit where multiple circles intersect.

### Circle 1: Business Relevance

Does this topic connect to what you sell?

A SaaS company writing about "cute cat videos" might get traffic, but it won't get customers. Every piece of content should have a logical path to your product or service.

**Questions to ask:**
- Could someone reading this eventually need what we sell?
- Does this topic attract our ideal customer or random traffic?
- Can we naturally mention our product without forcing it?

**Scoring:**
- Direct relevance (topic = our product category): High priority
- Adjacent relevance (topic leads to our product): Medium priority
- Distant relevance (only tangentially related): Low priority or skip

### Circle 2: Search Intent Match

What does someone actually want when they search this?

Search intent falls into four categories:

| Intent | What They Want | Content Type |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Informational | Learn something | Guide, tutorial, explanation |
| Navigational | Find a specific site/page | Brand page, product page |
| Commercial | Research before buying | Comparison, review, "best X" |
| Transactional | Buy now | Product page, pricing page |

**The mistake:** Writing informational content for transactional queries (or vice versa). Someone searching "buy running shoes" doesn't want a 3,000-word history of footwear.

**How to check intent:**
- Google the keyword and look at what's ranking
- If it's all product pages, you need a product page
- If it's all guides, you need a guide
- Match the format that's already winning

### Circle 3: Ranking Difficulty

Can you actually rank for this?

Difficulty depends on:
- Domain authority of competing sites
- Quality of existing content
- Number of backlinks competitors have
- Your site's current authority

**The new site rule:** If you're starting out, avoid keywords where the top 10 results are all from sites like Forbes, HubSpot, or Wikipedia. You won't outrank them for years.

**Finding winnable keywords:**
- Look for forums, Reddit posts, or weak content in top results
- Find keywords where small sites are ranking
- Target long-tail variations (more specific = less competition)
- Look for questions without good answers

**Difficulty assessment without tools:**
- All top 10 are major brands: Very hard (avoid)
- Mix of big and small sites: Medium (possible)
- Forums, old content, thin content in top 5: Easy (target these)

### Circle 4: Search Volume Reality

Is anyone actually searching for this?

Volume matters, but not as much as people think.

**The volume trap:** A keyword with 10,000 monthly searches where you rank #47 brings zero traffic. A keyword with 100 searches where you rank #1 brings ~30 visitors/month.

**Volume sweet spots:**
- High volume (10k+): Usually too competitive, save for later
- Medium volume (1k-10k): Good if difficulty is manageable
- Low volume (100-1k): Often the best opportunity
- Very low (<100): Fine for highly commercial terms

**How to estimate without paid tools:**
- Google Keyword Planner (free with Google Ads account) shows ranges
- Look at "People also ask" for related opportunities
- Check autocomplete suggestions (popular searches appear first)
- Use Google Trends to compare relative popularity

### Circle 5: Content Gap

What's missing from existing content?

The best opportunities are where current content is:
- Outdated (references old tools, data, or methods)
- Incomplete (doesn't fully answer the question)
- Too basic (expert searchers need more depth)
- Too complex (beginners need simpler explanations)
- Wrong format (text when video would help, or vice versa)

**Gap analysis process:**
1. Search the keyword
2. Read the top 3-5 results
3. Note what's missing, wrong, or could be better
4. That gap is your angle

**Common gaps:**
- "Updated for 2024/2025" (date-sensitive topics)
- Real examples vs. theory
- Actionable steps vs. vague advice
- Specific niche focus vs. generic coverage

### Circle 6: Your Unfair Advantage

What can you bring that others can't?

- Original data or research
- Unique experience or case studies
- Proprietary methodology
- Access to experts or interviews
- Better design or presentation
- Deeper expertise in a niche

**The differentiation question:** If your content is identical to what exists, why would Google rank you higher?

You need at least one unfair advantage per piece. If you can't identify one, find a different topic or create an advantage (run a survey, interview experts, share your own data).

## The Prioritization Matrix

Once you have a list of potential topics, score them:

| Topic | Business Relevance | Rankability | Volume | Gap | Advantage | SCORE |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|--------|-----|-----------|-------|
| Topic A | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 13 |
| Topic B | 2 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 8 |
| Topic C | 3 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 12 |

Score each factor 1-3 (1 = low, 3 = high). Prioritize by total score.

**Weighting adjustments:**
- New sites: Weight rankability higher (you need wins to build authority)
- Established sites: Weight volume and business relevance higher
- Limited resources: Weight advantage higher (don't compete head-to-head)

---

## Topic Clustering

Don't write isolated articles. Build topic clusters.

**How clusters work:**
1. **Pillar page:** Broad overview of a main topic (2,000-4,000 words)
2. **Cluster pages:** Deep dives into subtopics (1,000-2,000 words each)
3. **Internal links:** Every cluster page links to the pillar, pillar links to all clusters

**Example cluster: "Email Marketing"**
- Pillar: The Complete Guide to Email Marketing
- Clusters:
  - Email subject line best practices
  - How to segment your email list
  - Email automation workflows
  - Email deliverability tips
  - Welcome email sequence examples

**Why clusters work:**
- Signals topical authority to Google
- Keeps visitors on your site longer
- Creates natural internal linking
- One pillar can rank for dozens of keywords

**Building a cluster:**
1. Choose a pillar topic you can own
2. Brainstorm every subtopic and question
3. Group subtopics into logical cluster pages
4. Map internal linking structure before writing
5. Write cluster pages first, pillar last (you'll know more)

## The Research Process (Without Paid Tools)

### Step 1: Seed Brainstorm (15 min)

List everything your ideal customer might search for:
- Problems they have
- Questions they ask before buying
- Tasks they need to do
- Comparisons they make
- Terms they use (not industry jargon—their words)

### Step 2: Expand with Free Tools (30 min)

**Google Autocomplete:**
- Type your seed keyword, note suggestions
- Add letters (keyword a, keyword b, keyword c...)
- Add question words (how to keyword, what is keyword...)

**People Also Ask:**
- Search your keyword, expand every PAA box
- Those questions are content ideas

**Related Searches:**
- Scroll to bottom of Google results
- These are semantically related opportunities

**Google Keyword Planner:**
- Enter seed keywords
- Export suggestions with volume ranges
- Filter to relevant terms

**Answer the Public / AlsoAsked:**
- Enter topic, get question variations
- Great for FAQ content and long-tail keywords

### Step 3: Competitor Mining (20 min)

Find competitors ranking for your target topics:
1. Search your main keywords
2. Identify sites that rank repeatedly
3. Browse their blog/content section
4. Note topics they cover that you don't

**Look for:**
- Topics with clear search intent
- Content that's outdated or thin (opportunities)
- Gaps in their coverage you could fill

### Step 4: Validate and Score (20 min)

For each candidate keyword:
1. Google it
2. Assess difficulty (who's ranking?)
3. Check intent (what format wins?)
4. Identify the gap (what's missing?)
5. Score using the prioritization matrix

### Step 5: Build the Calendar

Organize approved topics into a publishing calendar:

| Week | Topic | Type | Cluster | Target Keyword |
|------|-------|------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Topic A | Cluster | Email | "email subject lines" |
| 2 | Topic B | Cluster | Email | "email segmentation" |
| 3 | Topic C | Pillar | Email | "email marketing guide" |

**Sequencing tips:**
- Publish cluster content before pillars
- Group related topics together (momentum on a theme)
- Mix difficulty (some quick wins, some investments)
- Leave room for timely/reactive content

## Common Keyword Research Mistakes

**Chasing volume over intent**
High-volume informational keywords rarely convert. A 200-search commercial keyword often drives more revenue than a 10,000-search informational one.

**Ignoring what's already ranking**
If the top 10 are all listicles, don't write an essay. Match the winning format.

**Keyword stuffing in 2024**
Google understands topics, not just exact-match keywords. Write naturally. Cover the topic thoroughly. The keywords will be there.

**Not updating old content**
A refreshed post often outranks a new post. Audit existing content before creating new.

**Writing for search engines, not humans**
Rankings get you traffic. Quality keeps them there. Write for humans first, optimize second.

## Output

When asked for keyword research, produce:

1. **Seed keyword expansion** — 20-50 relevant keywords/topics
2. **Prioritized list** — Top 10-15 opportunities with scoring
3. **Cluster map** — How topics group into pillars and clusters
4. **Content calendar** — Suggested publishing sequence
5. **Quick wins** — 3-5 topics that could rank fastest

Include reasoning for prioritization, not just the list. Explain why certain topics rank higher than others.
