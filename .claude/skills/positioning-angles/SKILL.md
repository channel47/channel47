# Positioning Angles

Find the angle that makes something sell. 8 frameworks to surface differentiated hooks before you write a word.

---

## Why Angles Matter

The same product positioned differently can convert at 2% or 20%.

Most copy fails before the first word is written. Not because the writing is bad, but because the angle is wrong—or worse, there is no angle. Just feature lists dressed up as benefits.

An angle is the strategic decision about *how* you'll enter the conversation. It's not what you say. It's the frame through which everything you say makes sense.

Bad products with great angles outsell good products with no angle. Every time.

## The 8 Positioning Frameworks

### 1. Enemy Positioning

Every story needs a villain. Define what you're against, and you give people something to rally around.

**How it works:**
Position your brand against an enemy—a competitor, an outdated approach, a broken system, or a philosophical problem. The enemy creates contrast. Contrast creates clarity.

**The enemy can be:**
- A competitor (Mac vs. PC)
- An outdated way of doing things (Uber vs. taxis)
- A system or institution (Dollar Shave Club vs. "Big Razor")
- A philosophy or mindset (Basecamp vs. hustle culture)
- A common frustration (Slack vs. email overload)

**How to find your enemy:**
- What does your customer hate about the current options?
- What's the "old way" your product replaces?
- What belief does your product disprove?
- What would your ideal customer rant about at a bar?

**Example:**
- Generic: "We make project management software"
- With enemy: "Spreadsheets are where projects go to die. We built something that actually works."

**Warning:** Don't punch down. Attack ideas, systems, or categories—not specific people. And make sure you can actually deliver on the alternative.

---

### 2. Unique Mechanism

The secret ingredient that makes your solution work. Not *what* you do, but *how* you do it differently.

**How it works:**
When markets get saturated, promises stop working. Everyone claims the same results. The unique mechanism answers: "Why does YOUR thing work when everything else failed?"

**The mechanism can be:**
- A proprietary process ("Our 6-Circle Method")
- A technology or ingredient ("Powered by GPT-4")
- A counterintuitive approach ("We delete features, not add them")
- A specific methodology ("The Jobs-to-be-Done framework")
- A constraint that creates advantage ("We only work with 10 clients per year")

**How to find your mechanism:**
- What do you do differently that competitors don't?
- What's your unfair advantage?
- What would a customer be surprised to learn about how you work?
- What's the "secret" behind why your best customers succeeded?

**Example:**
- Generic: "Lose weight with our program"
- With mechanism: "Lose weight by eating MORE—our Metabolic Multiplication method resets your body's fat-burning potential"

**Warning:** The mechanism must be real and defensible. Made-up mechanisms erode trust. If you don't have a genuine unique approach, find a different angle.

---

### 3. Category Creation

Don't compete in a crowded category. Create a new one and own it.

**How it works:**
Instead of being "another X," you become "the first Y." Category creators set the rules, define the criteria, and become the default choice.

**Category creation tactics:**
- Combine two things ("Conversational marketing" = live chat + marketing automation)
- Narrow the focus ("CRM for real estate agents")
- Elevate the category ("Not a tool—a platform")
- Rename the problem ("You don't have a marketing problem, you have a positioning problem")

**How to find your category:**
- What would you name the space if you could name it?
- What do customers call you that's different from your competitors?
- What two categories could you combine?
- What emerging behavior are you enabling?

**Example:**
- Generic: "We make live chat software"
- Category creation: "We invented conversational marketing—turn every website visitor into a qualified lead through real-time conversation"

**Warning:** Category creation is a long game. You're not just selling a product—you're educating a market. This requires commitment and budget. Don't fake category creation by adding buzzwords.

---

### 4. Contrarian Positioning

Challenge the conventional wisdom. Say what others won't.

**How it works:**
Take a widely-held belief in your industry and argue the opposite. This creates instant differentiation and attracts people who secretly agree but haven't heard anyone say it out loud.

**Contrarian approaches:**
- "Everything you've been told about X is wrong"
- "The industry is lying to you"
- "The best don't do what you think"
- "We do the opposite of everyone else"

**How to find your contrarian angle:**
- What does everyone in your industry believe that you disagree with?
- What's the "best practice" that actually doesn't work?
- What would be controversial to say in your industry?
- What do you know from experience that contradicts popular advice?

**Example:**
- Generic: "We help you grow your email list"
- Contrarian: "Stop trying to grow your list. A smaller, engaged list beats a big dead one every time. Here's how to shrink your list and increase revenue."

**Warning:** Contrarian only works if you can back it up. Being contrarian for attention without substance makes you look like a troll. And pick your battles—contrarian on everything is just exhausting.

---

### 5. Transformation Positioning

Sell the after, not the product. Make the customer the hero of their own story.

**How it works:**
People don't buy products. They buy better versions of themselves. The transformation framework focuses on the journey from "before" state (pain, frustration, limitation) to "after" state (success, relief, capability).

**The transformation structure:**
1. Before: What's life like now? (The pain)
2. After: What could life look like? (The promise)
3. Bridge: How does your product get them there? (The path)

**How to find the transformation:**
- What does your best customer's life look like after using your product?
- What can they do now that they couldn't before?
- What do they no longer have to worry about?
- What do they tell their friends about?

**Example:**
- Generic: "Time tracking software for freelancers"
- Transformation: "From chasing invoices to getting paid automatically. Finally, run your freelance business without the admin headache."

**Warning:** The transformation must be believable and achievable. Overpromising destroys trust. Focus on transformations your current customers have actually experienced.

---

### 6. Specificity Positioning

Vague claims are invisible. Specific claims stick.

**How it works:**
The human brain trusts specificity. "Lose weight" is forgettable. "Lose 12 pounds in 6 weeks" is memorable. Specific numbers, timeframes, and details create credibility even before you provide proof.

**Types of specificity:**
- Numbers: "47% faster" instead of "much faster"
- Timeframes: "In 14 days" instead of "quickly"
- Details: "Works for B2B SaaS companies with 10-50 employees" instead of "works for businesses"
- Constraints: "Only available until Friday" instead of "limited time"
- Process: "A 3-step system" instead of "our method"

**How to find specific angles:**
- What results have your best customers achieved? (Use real numbers)
- How long does it typically take to see results?
- How many people have you helped?
- What's the most surprising statistic about your product?

**Example:**
- Generic: "Grow your business with our marketing services"
- Specific: "We've helped 127 SaaS companies add $2.3M in ARR in the last 18 months"

**Warning:** Never invent specificity. Made-up statistics are fraud. If you don't have specific data yet, use specificity in other ways—specific processes, specific customer profiles, specific timeframes.

---

### 7. Origin Story Positioning

Where you came from matters. The underdog always gets the crowd.

**How it works:**
People connect with stories, not features. Your origin story—why you started, what you struggled with, how you got here—creates emotional connection and differentiates you from faceless competitors.

**Origin story elements:**
- The struggle: What problem did you face that led to creating this?
- The insight: What did you discover that others missed?
- The mission: What drives you beyond profit?
- The proof: How has the journey validated your approach?

**How to find your origin story:**
- Why did the founder(s) start this company?
- What frustration led to the first version?
- What did you try that didn't work before you found what did?
- What do customers sense about you that's different?

**Example:**
- Generic: "We build email marketing software"
- Origin story: "I was a broke creator sending emails from my apartment. Every tool was built for marketers with budgets. So I built ConvertKit for creators like me—people who'd rather make things than optimize funnels."

**Warning:** The origin story must be genuine. Fabricated underdog stories get exposed. And don't dwell too long—the story sets the stage, then you move to value.

---

### 8. Identity/Tribe Positioning

Define who you're for—and who you're not for.

**How it works:**
The clearest positioning isn't about what you do—it's about who you're for. By explicitly claiming a tribe, you create belonging for ideal customers and filter out poor fits.

**Identity positioning tactics:**
- Name the tribe: "Built for developers" / "For founders, not managers"
- Name the excluded: "Not for beginners" / "Enterprise? Look elsewhere"
- Signal shared values: "If you believe X, you'll love this"
- Use their language: Speak like an insider, not a marketer

**How to find your tribe:**
- Who are your best customers? What do they have in common?
- Who should NOT buy your product?
- What identity does your customer aspire to?
- How do your best customers describe themselves?

**Example:**
- Generic: "Project management for teams"
- Identity: "Basecamp is for companies that want to work calmer, not longer. If you worship at the altar of hustle culture, this isn't for you."

**Warning:** Be careful with exclusion. Excluding the wrong people is powerful. Excluding people based on demographics rather than values or fit is problematic.

## The Angle Discovery Process

### Step 1: Information Gathering

Before choosing an angle, collect:

- **Customer intel**: What language do they use? What do they complain about? What surprised them about your product?
- **Competitor audit**: How do others position? What angles are overused? What's the conventional wisdom?
- **Internal insight**: What do you believe that others don't? What's your unfair advantage? What's the origin story?
- **Results data**: What specific outcomes have customers achieved?

### Step 2: Generate Angle Options

Run through all 8 frameworks. For each, ask:
- "What would this angle look like for us?"
- "Do we have the proof/substance to back this up?"
- "Has anyone else claimed this?"

Generate at least 2-3 options per framework before evaluating.

### Step 3: Evaluate and Select

Rate each angle on:

| Criteria | Question |
|----------|----------|
| Differentiation | Does this set us apart? |
| Believability | Can we prove this? |
| Relevance | Does the customer care? |
| Defensibility | Can competitors copy this easily? |
| Clarity | Can you say it in one sentence? |

The best angle scores high on all five. If nothing does, you might need to create something new (unique mechanism, category creation) before you can position effectively.

### Step 4: Stress Test

Before committing, test the angle:
- Write 3 headlines using the angle—do they feel strong?
- Explain the angle to someone unfamiliar with your product—do they get it?
- Check if competitors have claimed similar positioning—is there room?
- Imagine a customer seeing this vs. a competitor—would they choose you?

---

## Combining Angles

Great positioning often combines 2-3 frameworks:

- **Enemy + Transformation**: "Escape the 9-5 (enemy) and build a business that runs without you (transformation)"
- **Unique Mechanism + Specificity**: "Our AI-powered analysis (mechanism) finds opportunities 3x faster (specificity)"
- **Identity + Contrarian**: "For developers who think no-code is a joke (identity + contrarian)"
- **Origin Story + Unique Mechanism**: "After failing with 12 different tools, I built the system that finally worked (origin + mechanism)"

---

## Angle Anti-Patterns

**"We're the best"** — No differentiation, just assertion. Everyone claims this.

**"We do everything"** — Trying to appeal to everyone appeals to no one. Specificity beats comprehensiveness.

**"Innovation + quality + service"** — The holy trinity of meaningless. These are baseline expectations, not positioning.

**"We're different"** — Different how? Without specificity, this is empty.

**"For everyone"** — If you're for everyone, you're for no one. The best positioning excludes.

**Copying the leader** — You can't out-Salesforce Salesforce. Find a different angle.

---

## Output

When asked to find positioning angles, produce:

1. **Angle options** — 3-5 distinct angles using different frameworks
2. **Recommended angle** — The strongest option with reasoning
3. **One-liner** — The angle expressed in a single sentence
4. **Proof requirements** — What you'd need to make this angle credible
5. **Headlines** — 3 example headlines using the angle

The angle should be specific enough to write from immediately—not a vague direction, but a concrete frame that shapes every piece of copy.
